Dear friends,

A couple days ago, I was sharing something that I found myself doing recently, that is, I've been reading the samples included in the books listed on [Amazon.co.jp](https://www.amazon.co.jp). In particular, I've been reading the books published by two well-known Japanese Esports players: [Tokido](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8D%E3%81%A9-ebook/dp/B081CKP8VH?ref_=ast_author_mpb) and [Daigo Umehara](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%A2%85%E5%8E%9F%E5%A4%A7%E5%90%BE-ebook/dp/B009YES5KA?ref_=ast_author_mpb).

Actually, they've written not only one book but several, and upon taking a look at the part starting from the "Beginning" onward, I found that Umehara's story is more compelling. I think that it's because there are aspects in his life that are similar to mine.

To give some examples, he said that both his parents work in the healthcare industry, his mother being a nurse. In addition, he has a sister who is older than him by eight years. In 2004, he went to the U.S. for the first time to join the Evolution (EVO) Tournament. It was there that he fought and competed against Justin Wong, America's strongest Street Fighter III player at the time. At that crucial moment when had only a single pixel of energy left, he beat Justin in a remarkable showcase of skill, and won the championship. 

Yet after several years, we ask what is Umehara's situation now? It seems that it has gone toward a different direction. 

On the other hand, perhaps Tokido would be able to answer this question about his own life, although that may be the topic of his next book.

For the time being, what we can see from the videos on YouTube is that even up to now, Tokido continues to join Esports tournaments, and still wins along with his team. 

But there remains the seemingly ever present question of whether or not his main source of income really does come from being an Esports player, or is he doing some other type of work that isn't seen on his channel. This part, I think, is something that may come out as a puzzle to viewers who're thinking about entering the world of Esports themselves.

Speaking of which, actually, Tokido has a second book in digital format.

Upon verifying the contents from the sample, I found that he had to change his strategy in order to win. This is because he couldn't anymore win using the same technique he's been using, which is to make use of the most powerful type of attack when confronting his opponents. At the same time, he makes minor adjustments based on the information he has obtained about them.

Tokido explains that since people can now quickly gather information through the internet, whatever winning tactic he employs could now be copied or defended against by his opponents.

As can be seen in Tokido's videos, it has become necessary for him to have a team. Team members help one another, and compensate for each other's weaknesses. This is why the team as a whole can continue to win. But since they'll also have to share the prize money among many members, it's also much smaller now for each one. Right now, it may still be enough for Tokido and his teammates, but this might not be true anymore in the near future.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
