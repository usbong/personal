Dear friends,

We again have plenty of videos from YouTube, and actually some of them I've already seen yesterday morning.

But today, what I'd like to share with you is the new video from Ms. OkanP. It's a video where she and Mr. Yoshiki OKAMOTO have gone out to visit the old office of Konami. We know that Mr. OKAMOTO had previously worked there prior to moving to Capcom.

While watching their video, I was reminded of Kagawa Prefecture in the island of Shikoku, because not a lot of people were there in the streets. Right now, I'd also include Nara City, which has a sense of being closer to nature than another city like Osaka.

When they finally sat down to have breakfast, we find that their table was much smaller, which meant that they also sat much closer to each other. My impression was that they were having a date. And maybe they were. 

Looking at Ms. OkanP's face, I noticed its similarity with those used with AI models, such as, for instance, Chun-Li from Street Fighter or Yuri from the King of Fighters.

Next, let me now also share with you something that I only just recently found out. Actually, it was right after I viewed an announcement about the new Final Fantasy x Magic The Gathering collaboration project.

I've mostly been listening to Japanese voice-overs, so I didn't know much about the English version. After doing a bit of searching on Google, I found a video where two of the voice actors of FF7 were sharing an experience they had working on the project.

That is how I learned about Suzie YEUNG, the voice actress of Yuffie.

In an interview with Game Maker's Notebook, we learn that she was able to get the role when an audition was held immediately after she arrived in Los Angeles. She says that if there hadn't been auditions right at that moment, it's likely that she wouldn't be in the industry right now. 

It's the type of story that my friend from San Francisco, Ryan PO, also often told me. A young girl was able to get the part and became a tremendous success. It seems that he likes those kinds of stories, and I'm sure that many people also do.

A video from Ghib Ojisan taken in L.A. advises us that people need to be passionate in their work, more so than the other guys who only work to get paid by their boss. 

I think that another essential factor is whether or not the female star could attract more viewers and gamers through her personal life story.

Yet, as always, there remains the problem of getting older and if there'll still be work for her to do in the coming future.

The Japanese, for their part, has someone like Mr. Yoshiki OKAMOTO, a former CAPCOM Producer  who has returned to his old team to help them out. The videos on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjuSyACqtoJEm3A1X87Zi6Q) show the projects they've since worked on together.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
