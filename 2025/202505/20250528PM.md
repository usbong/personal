> 【不安解消法】人は暇な時間があると不安になる｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us a technique to overcome worrying.

He says that worries come whenever we have free time. He gives the following thoughts and ideas as examples. A terrorist group has gone to a bank and committed an armed robbery, or an airplane going to Columbia suddenly crashes, so we shouldn't go to the bank or travel anymore.

Mr. Okamoto's technique teaches us that we should therefore have goals that we'd want to achieve, so that we won't have time for worrying anymore. We've gotten busier working on achieving our goals. 

Also, he advises us that we should forgive ourselves for our failures and shortcomings, because after all, we are not perfect beings.

Finally, he says that if there's something that we can't do, let's decide now that we won't do it anymore.

To this I'd add that we should not forget to face whatever consequences that may arise out of our own actions.

This is all.

Thank you, good night.

Regards,

Mike
