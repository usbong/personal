> 【世界で大ヒット】実写映画マインクラフト・ザ・ムービーの魅力

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's lecture is about the flick, "Minecraft The Movie."

He says that in fact in just three weeks, the movie was able to hit 100 billion yen in sales worldwide, thereby making it a huge success.

Also, since it's based on the video game, children and their parents, practically everyone, could enjoy the film.

While it took awhile before it arrived in Japan, Mr. Okamoto highly recommends it to people, saying that they should go out and watch it.

If I were to share my own thoughts on the matter, while I think that it's a film that could make people who watch it laugh, it doesn't mean that all the scenes in the movie would be funny. But perhaps because the parts that are funny last longer in our memory, viewers may still very well be laughing, while the scenes that are corny and aren't so funny pass by on the screen.

This is all.

Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
