Dear friends,

Tonight, it appears that Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki isn't going to upload a new lecture, but, as always, we do have plenty from YouTube that we can talk about.

For instance, the channel, Meta Developer, has shared a meet-up between Mark Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella who discuss AI and how Microsoft is using the technology.

Moreover, we can focus on the interaction between the two leaders, which gave me the impression that I've met the type of personality that Mark exuded. That is, he lets Satya talk, and Satya shares with everyone his take on the matter at hand. Afterward, Mark responds that he finds everything that Satya said interesting, and then continues to ask Satya several more questions. 

It seemed that Mark didn't care too much about whatever Satya said, and what he only wanted was to let Satya continue to talk. I, myself, was under the impression that Satya would get angry soon after. But perhaps because Satya already knew about this tactic, or Mark's company has actually given them at Microsoft a huge leg-up, Satya couldn't be angry. 

Finally, I personally thought that Satya's sharing of the use of technology and metadata to think with Excel, write with Word, and talk with Powerpoint was remarkable, because it gave the impression that we are moving so much closer than ever to the goal of easily transferring information to any form.

Before I end, I'd like to share with everyone the Moomin channel, which has been gracious enough to share its anime, something I had never seen before.

I think that its English dubbing is also remarkable, and I was reminded of the game, Disgaea, and its development company, Nippon Ichi Software, which although uses the same kind of dubbing, has a different feel to its product line-up that I've attributed to its content, which includes the story script. Still, maybe it's only really because I'm not their target market at all.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
