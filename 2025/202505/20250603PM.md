> 日本を元気にする方法をバリの兄貴に相談してみた(丸尾孝俊さん対談③) #アニキリゾートライフ #神様はバリにいる

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto and Mr. Aniki from Bali ("Aniki" means "Older Brother") are continuing with their talk of the previous days. This time, Mr. Okamoto asks, "What is the way to invigorate Japan?"

Mr. Aniki explains that the person who can bring together people would be able to invigorate Japan. He then gives examples such as Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu, among others, who've done it.

He also adds that it's important that there are people who'd actually ask him certain things. If not, and nobody cared, he'd simply be told to "Go Home!" But because people would want to understand why this boy is here, he then has the opportunity to bring people together.

Thus, Mr. Aniki says that it's best to first begin at the lowest rank, gradually getting recognized by people along the way. Afterward, once the person's at the center of everyone's life, he'd then be able to bring together the whole nation.

This is all.

Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
