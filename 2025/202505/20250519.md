Dear friends,

Yesterday evening, it appeared to me that Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto wouldn't anymore upload a new lecture, so in the other classes, I had opted to share two videos on EVO Japan 2025. The first is from Tokido who was sharing his experience in his new video, while the second is a set of interviews conducted by the team at IGN Japan during the said event. Afterward, I'd also like to share with you something about a friend of mine from Hong-Kong whom I met in Japan.

During this year's EVO Japan 2025, over 6,000 participants were said to have attended the event. IGN Japan explains in their video that from among these players, those who won made use of attacks and combos that dealt massive amounts of damage to quickly win the fights. In fact, this is something that we can see in Tokido's video, especially during his first matches at the tournament, where he made use of the said tactic to quickly defeat his opponents.

Moreover, IGN Japan reports that EVO Japan is working toward helping all the participants bring home something that only EVO Japan could offer, such as, for instance, a memorable experience. In my opinion, if none could be gained from it, there wouldn't be any reason to join the event again the following year.

In addition, I noticed that Tokido's voice after his fight was markedly better than when he's talking with the people at REJECT or in his own YouTube channel, and I hope that we could listen to this type of voice even more if possible.

Finally, I'd now like to share with you the IG of my friend, Yen, who is someone I met when I went to Japan for further studies.

She's actually from Hong-Kong, and is already married. When she also went to Japan for studies, she didn't go alone, but instead went there with her batchmates.

At the time, Yen's Japanese proficiency level was higher than mine. Based on our Japanese language classes, if the highest is level 6, the first class she took was at level 5, while I only reached level 3. Actually, I wanted to begin the first semester at level 4, but the teacher didn't let me. Still, I am grateful that thanks to his good judgement, I was able to jump to level 5 in the second semester.

Right now, Yen is a writer and content creator, as well as a mother and spouse.

Viewing her video, we can see her playing the UFO catcher in Japan. I didn't know that she plays this sort of game, because my initial impression of her was that she was a serious student of the Japanese language.

I also thought that before playing, she had brought the stuffed toys when they were taking the photo as a kind of joke, and maybe it's because I also thought that nobody ever won the UFO catcher. Yet, as we can see in her video, she did get to win the plushies together with her friends.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
