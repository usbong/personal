Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki OKAMOTO has uploaded a new Live YouTube video where he and Ms. Tapi share their thoughts on the things that people look for or find appealing at every decade of their life. 

I've already written about the first decade up until the 80's in the other classes, so right now, I'll be continuing on from the 90's.

Mr. OKAMOTO says that by the time a person reaches his 90's, he'd be satisfied if he could go to the bathroom by himself. 

By his 100's, he'd be satisifed by simply being alive.

This is all. 

Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
