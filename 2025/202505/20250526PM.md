Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto and Ms. Tapi are sharing with us through a quiz the dialect in Ainancho, Mr. Okamoto's province. Mr. Okamoto says that it's been 45 years since he left his hometown.

In the video, Mr. Okamoto first says a phrase, and then Ms. Tapi has to guess its meaning.

Mr. Okamoto explains that there are some words that were used before, but are now not anymore used by young people.

A phrase that I found interesting is "juu ga warui," which means that nothing fits well.

When I heard the phrase, I remembered from "juu," freedom and America. In Japan, there was a point in time when those who were advancing too much the ideas from the U.S. were later arrested, because they even went so far as to break the law in order to make money, or made people spend even more money. I think that this was an incident that occurred around the 80's and 90's.

This is all.

Thank you, good night.

Regards,

Mike
