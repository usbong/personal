> 【ドバイ案件】昨今の若い女性の海外手稼ぎ事案について思うこと｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto has published a new lecture wherein he shares with us an incident that occurred in Dubai involving a rather young Japanese woman who went there to sell sex, and got in return a traumatic experience.

Mr. Okamoto tells us that the young woman even wrote a contract saying that she is to receive 20 million yen per hour, so that for one night, she is to be paid a sum total of 100 million yen.

Mr. Okamoto explains that in general a Japanese office worker (the so-called salaryman) would need to work for four to five years to obtain 20 million, and would therefore need to work continuously for 25 years in order to obtain 100 million yen.

Mr. Okamoto also adds that in the first place, selling sex in Dubai is prohibited, so that the untoward incident that the young woman experienced is a reminder to all of us that the world isn't so sweet.

This is all.

Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
