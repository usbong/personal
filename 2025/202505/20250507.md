> Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Agility, AI Strategy, and the Changing Role of Managers

Generative AI helps customers find things, giving them recommendations.

At present, Amazon.com can do a good job as a service if the customer already knows what he's looking for, but not so otherwise.

Andy recommends that we do the things that we'd do everyday, without fearing failure. It means that we continuously learn.

In his role as CEO, knowing the details is important, even if there are people who'd only want the general idea. For instance, what projects is the company working on? 

He gets thousands of emails from customers giving feedback, and by listening, especially to those who are experiencing great pains in the service, the company could improve.

At the end of the day, he asks himself whether he did what he said he'd do, which is to provide a great customer service experience.

He admits that education still remains a problem in the U.S. even to this day. But we do know that people pay attention when it's about themselves.
