> 日本のソウルフード『卵かけご飯(TKG)』が海外で流行らないのはなぜ？｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki OKAMOTO has a new lecture where he shares with us a distinct Japanese cuisine involving a raw egg that is put on top of cooked rice. 

He says that in other countries, people would prefer to eat cooked eggs, which is why he gives us several reasons to explain how come raw eggs are eaten in the Land of the Rising Sun.

First is that chickens in Japan are put in cages where they don't get too much contact with bacteria such as the Salmonella.

Here in Marikina City, when it was still a province, chickens could freely move around, so that they also frequently touched the dirt on the ground.

Another reason he gives is that since there's the possibility that the egg shell might be dirty, the eggs are said to be cleaned much more thoroughly in Japan.

Finally, right now, while the price of eggs is relatively low when compared to other food, he advises that safety is of utmost importance, even if we'd also need to pay more.

This is all.

Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
