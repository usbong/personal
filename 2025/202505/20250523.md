Dear friends,

A couple days ago, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto spoke about his thoughts on U.S. President Trump's mutually imposed tariffs. But before he began to share his take on the matter, he first admitted that he's not an economist so that we may find errors in what he says.

Concerning the mutual tariffs, Mr. Okamoto believes that since President Trump is a businessman, the U.S. president is naturally working toward making America profitable. However, what we find from the news is that U.S. trade is now 185 trillion yen in deficit.

This is why even the Nintendo Switch 2's arrival in the U.S. has been delayed.

Mr. Okamoto also gave as example the case of Japan, where the country has placed tariffs in important industries such as those involving beef, among other agricultural products, in order to protect the businesses of its local companies.

With regard to this point, my own opinion is that when President Trump first began serving in the highest position of the country, we may have also had the impression that he and his partners would make huge profits in their businesses. 

But the truth is that they've suffered great losses according to The Economist. Nevertheless, employees working under the Trump administration continued to do significant work, even though they didn't quite like what the U.S. president was doing.

Next, let me now share a little bit about the presentation by Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on the topic about "The World Health Assembly 2025."

In his talk, what I'd like to emphasize is the part where he says that global problems aren't solved by Singapore alone, but are instead solved through collaboration with other nations of the world. 

I think that in school, there are times when we'd find group members who don't do their assigned tasks, and the leader would have to exert a lot more effort in order to finish the project. My advice is to give the teacher the names of these members who don't work and don't contribute.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
