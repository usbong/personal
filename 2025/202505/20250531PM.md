> 【ポケポケ】神ゲーだけど引退します…岡本吉起がポケポケを辞めるに至った経緯 #pokepoke

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto has announced that he's quitting Poke Poke or the Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket. 

First, Mr. Okamoto explains that the idea of collecting cards is something that gets people to feel attracted to the game, but he finds that the versus battles aren't really too interesting.

He believes that the version where printed cards are used is so much better than this digital version, where in order to win, the player is discouraged from making the first attack, and instead should defend, which, as he explains, causes the game to take too long a time to finish. For someone like Mr. Okamoto who doesn't have plenty of time, it would be better for him to quit this game and play another one instead.

Also, while there are games, which a person would quit but would still return to after awhile, for Mr. Okamoto, this isn't that sort of game at all.

Finally, Mr. Okamoto thanks the company who made Poke Poke, which because of their effort and hard work, there are still people who play their game even up to now. He adds that even if a person like himself already quit the game, it doesn't necessarily mean that the value of the company's stocks would go down.

This is all.

Thank you, good night.

Regards,

Mike
