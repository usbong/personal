Dear friends,

Today, I'd like to share with you Mr. Yoshiki OKAMOTO's answers to several questions that was asked him when he had his YouTube Live last Friday. Afterward, I'll be sharing with you my thoughts on Ms. Hikaru UTADA's Apple Music interview and her new  music video on "THE FIRST TAKE" channel.

During Mr. OKAMOTO's last YouTube Live video, he shared with us that he and his team have actually been working on a generative AI girl project inside their company, and that they've been enjoying coming up with a story for the said project. Already they have the ending finalized, and they're now having fun putting in the details like the AI girl's birthday, among other things. A question from a viewer was also raised on whether or not he could receive a homemade Valentine's cake from the AI girl. Mr. OKAMOTO's response was that while giving cakes during Valentine's Day is a Japanese cultural tradition, they wouldn't be able to fulfill such a request if they don't have the production capacity needed to deliver to supermarkets. He explained that without it, they wouldn't be able to guarantee the food safety of the said cake in terms of the ingredients that would be put inside it.

At this point, let me now share with you my thoughts on the two videos of Ms. Hikaru UTADA. In the first video, where she was having an interview at Apple Music, I was able to listen to her English for the very first time. I heard a number of words and phrases that reminded me of those used in TV shows and similar programs, and I think that it just means that she often listens to podcasts or watches videos.

Ms. UTADA's pronunciation gave me the impression that her English is similar to British English. I thought that, naturally, through practice, she'd be able to improve even further.

Lastly, in her music video on "THE FIRST TAKE," we could learn about the type of music that she enjoys. In addition to having an 80's tune, I thought that it was the type of sound that played during the time when Whitney Houston debuted. We could even say that it's the kind of music we'd hear from the car radio as we're coming back home at eight o'clock or so in the evening.

As the last portions of the song begin to play, we may notice the marked difference in the music from when it was only starting. Somehow, I was able to remember Mr. Takuya KIMURA whom we might believe to be her dear friend, and with whom, we could imagine, she shares unforgettable moments together and which are fondly remembered even to this day.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
