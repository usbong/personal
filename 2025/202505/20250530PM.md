Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto and Ms. Tapi have conducted a YouTube live video where Mr. Okamoto shared with us his plans after retirement.

First, he says that he's going to go to a beach in the southern part of Japan, where he could relax on a hammock and listen to the waves. He wants to spend his days doing this sort of thing every day, especially after having worked hard for 45 years.

Next, he's thinking about experiencing things he's never experienced before. For instance, he wants to go to Eastern Europe, not for business purposes, but for leisure. In Japan, he wants to travel the whole country riding a car. These are part of his plan to experience new things.

Finally, he again spoke about his dream of becoming an architect, someone who designs houses that people would live in. He also says that foreigners are welcome to live in these houses. He believes that through rent and the sale of the house, he could live a decent life, although he made clear that he won't sell the house to someone who doesn't appreciate its design.

This is all.

Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
