First, he says that he has returned to Japan, and that because the situation between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla President Elon Musk has gotten worse, he has sold all the Tesla stocks that he had owned. The fight between these two men scares him into thinking that the said stocks aren't going to continue to go up any longer.

At this point, we may recall the explanation of Mr. Joi Ito about the reason for the conflict between the two.

Ito-san explains that Mr. Musk wanted to be the head chief of Nasa as was agreed upon between him and Mr. Trump, but in the end, Mr. Trump couldn't give him the position. We know that Mr. Musk's company, SpaceX, has projects with Nasa, and if he can also be head chief at Nasa, he'll have the decision making power to give SpaceX more projects that will also convert into more income for the company, among others.

Finally, Okamoto-san adds that he still owns Roblox stocks, and although he thinks of selling all of them, he has decided to keep them.

In his talk, he also mentioned that he makes money out of the buying and selling of stocks, something he finds fun to do like playing a game. And we may think that it's the technique that he uses to make a lot of money in the video games industry. I think that it'll be interesting to know if Mr. Masahiro Sakurai also does the same thing.

This is all. Thank you.

Regards,
