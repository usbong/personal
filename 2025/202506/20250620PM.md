According to Okamoto-san, first and foremost, the history between these two nations isn't light reading. But if we were to go back to the time when they were still friends, we'll find a moment in their history when the leader of the Iranian government at the time thought of changing the country's direction to veer more toward Europe, instead of the United States. 

However, the said leader couldn't successfully carry out this plan, leading to many students disagreeing with it. Meanwhile, the leader of Islam at the time reminded the country that this problem could occur.

Thus, the Iranian government again changed the direction of the nation to be much closer to the religion. Afterward, during the time when the country was fighting terrorist organizations, they identified Israel, along with the United States, to be the ones who've been producing these terrorist organizations.

Most recently, as we have heard from the news, Israel has launched missiles to attack Iran, and since the countries around Iran have obtained good agreements with the U.S., they won't be able to help Iran in its war.

This is all.

Okamoto-san's telling of the story is quite interesting, even though it was a little difficult to understand, and I had to close my eyes and not watch his video to be able to listen well.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
