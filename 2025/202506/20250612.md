Dear friends,

Today let me share with you a few stories from Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto about the Omiyage or the souvenirs that he bought as presents during his trips abroad back in the time of Emperor Showa.

In those days, Mr. Okamoto had gone on trips abroad, and his bosses would tell him to bring home tobacco. In Japan, a carton cost 200 yen, but if a traveler bought a set of 10 boxes abroad, it would only cost a mere 1,000 yen. It was so inexpensive that after returning to the office, another boss of his would want one too.

This practice of bringing home souvenirs as gifts had become a custom that whenever an employee went out for business trips abroad, his boss would give him as much as 30,000 yen as Omiyage allowance. Aside from tobacco, there were also whiskeys and brandies like "Camus" that bosses wanted. Perfumes like "Chanel" in particular also tended to be prized. However, these were comparatively more expensive.

Finally, Mr. Okamoto reveals that the tour guides who brought visitors to tourist spots and the so-called Omiyage stores made quite a sum of money from the 20 to 25% of what is known as "kickbacks."

This is all.

Thank you.
