Dear friends,

Today I'll be sharing with you several pieces of news from the channels and sites that I visit.

First, I'll be talking about Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's new YouTube Live Video, and then I'll say something about a couple sites and a video that I also viewed.

The theme of Mr. Okamoto's video is rice. He says that in Japan the price of rice has gone up. He adds that there are several likely causes for the change. One is that there has been a demand for the increased pricing. Another is that Japan doesn't have enough rice for everyone, so that if the country increased its price, fewer people would buy it, especially during times when it isn't necessary.

Mr. Okamoto also says that this pricing is the same one they had 30 years ago. During the time when his daughter was still in high school, their household bought 20kg of price for 20,000 yen. He explains that they bought this type of rice because of its good quality. The other rice that their household bought was the "genmai."

Right now, since he's living in Malaysia, he likes to buy rice from Thailand, even though rice from Japan is also available. In Malaysia, the price of Japanese rice is much cheaper than in Japan.

Finally, I'd also like to share with you that today, June 6, is the 27th anniversary of [Hobonichi](https://www.1101.com/). It's also the anniversary of the first issue of the Famitsu magazine published in the 80's.

I agree with what Mr. Comugi had said in that it seems that there are plenty of activities currently making use of NFT, Blockchain and similar technologies, and applying them in their own projects. But we'd definitely also like to see if there's real progress in terms of the interaction between producers, investors and the community.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
