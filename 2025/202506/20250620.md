Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us his thoughts on the rule that says that "The actions of an insane person aren't punishable."

According to Okamoto-san, because of this rule, an insane person who's committed a crime, even if it's murder, cannot be sentenced the most severe punishment present in the law. Okamoto-san is among those who'd want the most severe punishment be given.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
