Dear friends,

Today I'd like to share with you that from the two videos that Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto uploaded last night, I chose to watch the one where he talks about his "Tree House." Actually, he explains that it's a house beside a tree, and not a house above a tree or something like that.

Mr. Okamoto also says that it had cost him 17 million yen to build. However, he reveals to us that his design has several flaws.

First is that its two air-conditioning machines don't work as they should, because there are gaps in the flooring through which its cold air passes, so that the temperature doesn't go down.

Second, while he wanted to relax in the said house, his dog becomes very noisy when he brings it to the Tree House. He explains that it's because it still hasn't gotten used to the new environment.

Third, the ladder that he has inside the house is difficult to use for climbing up to the second floor.

Mr. Okamoto gives several other problems concerning the said house, but in the end, he now knows how to improve its design if he's given another opportunity to build a similar house.

Next, before I end, I'd like to share with you that John Romero has launched a video that appeared among my YouTube recommendations last night as well.

> FPS FRIDAY: Romero plays Half-Life 2 

## --

It's about Half-Life 2, and in the video, he shows himself playing the game. I haven't yet seen the video, but when I visited [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Romero666), I saw that he also has another one wherein he's playing DOOM: The Dark Ages.

It reminded me that knowing the reason why players choose a game or a video instead of another helps us in designing our next games, even though we know that the entertainment industry doesn't guarantee that the best in terms of gameplay and the like will win.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
