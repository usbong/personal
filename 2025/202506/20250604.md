Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto and Mr. Aniki from Bali ("Aniki" means "Older Brother") are continuing with their talk, which they began a couple of days ago. This time, Mr. Okamoto asks, "What is the way to invigorate Japan?"

Mr. Aniki explains that the person who can bring together people would be able to invigorate Japan. He then gives examples such as Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu, among others, who've done it.

He also adds that it's important that there are people who'd actually want to know certain things about the person and ask him questions. Otherwise, if nobody cared, he'd simply be told to "Go home!" But because people would want to understand why the boy is here, he then has the opportunity to bring people together.

Thus, Mr. Aniki says that it's best to first begin at the lowest rank, gradually getting recognized by people along the way as the person moves higher. Afterward, once he's at the center of everyone's life, he'd then be able to bring together the whole nation.

This is all.

Thank you, good night!
