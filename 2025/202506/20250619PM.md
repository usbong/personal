> 刑法「心神喪失者の行為は、罰しない」の原則に疑問があります｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us his thoughts on the rule that says that "The actions of an insane person aren't punishable."

According to Okamoto-san, because of this rule, even if a person murdered another person, since he's insane, he cannot be sentenced the most severe punishment in the law. Okamoto-san is among those who'd want the most severe punishment be given.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
