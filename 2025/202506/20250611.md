Dear friends,

Today I have three videos.

The first is a video where Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto says that the time when games and high-end brands like Louis Vuitton join forces has finally arrived.

Starting off from Mr. Okamoto's video, we learn that Fendi, a high-end brand, has collaborated with Pokémon to produce women's bags. This means that more people have finally come to recognize the value of video games. As you may all know, the video games industry is relatively young, which is why Mr. Okamoto hopes that there'll be more games geared toward older people in the coming future.

Next, Director Hideo Kojima mentions in his KOJI 10 radio program the value of being validated by people. This means that our challenge whenever we create a piece of work is to get more people to appreciate our work instead of only ourselves. 

He also points out that the music may be amazing, but it's really only one component, and we must think about the larger work that we're building as well.

In John Romero's video, he introduces SIGIL II, a game based on DOOM and which he developed a year ago. During that time, he created several stages for the game. 

Speaking about my perspective on this, I'd say that the least we can get in the video games industry is the piece of work that we ourselves have made an effort to build. While there might not be too many people who share the same sense of appreciation for our work, we must enjoy the piece of work that we ourselves have created.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
