According to Okamoto-san, he's never taken this exam, although he's undergone a medical exam wherein a small camera was used to view his stomach.

Okamoto-san explains that the exam with the barium, which is shaped as a piece of chocolate and is drunk, is done in order to investigate the health of a person if he has cancer or some other disease. Further, Okamoto-san points out that the exam makes the patient move and turn while strapped to a machine, and which uses X-rays to take photos. Okamoto-san also says that when a patient drinks the barium, he should take a laxative, otherwise, he'll end up having to undergo surgery. Thus, there are people who think that this exam itself causes people to have cancer.

Finally, Okamoto-san concludes that it seems to him that what can be found in the stomach with a small camera is already enough. Moreover, there are many ways to put the camera into the body, although what he experienced had not been the most convenient, that is, through the mouth instead of the nose, because the hole of the latter was too small, such that he had bled too much blood. Still, he advises people to also experience it, and if there's a medical doctor who advises taking the exam with the barium and he himself takes it, Okamoto-san wants to hear his opinion.

This is all.

Thank you.
