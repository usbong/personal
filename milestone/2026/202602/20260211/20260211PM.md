Okamoto-san admits that it's been his dream to invest in a company known as a "unicorn" or a "ten-bagger" like Jumia and earn 10, 100, 1000 or more times.

According to Okamoto-san, right now, there are many companies that are starting up like this in Africa, and whenever e-commerce is talked about, the name that is often mentioned is Jumia, "the Amazon of Africa."

Further, he reveals that the infrastructure in Africa is still being developed, such that there are no drones yet at the moment. Moreover, people use mobile phones to buy instead of through the bank. Okamoto-san thinks that maybe this is the same method of buying that investors like him want for advanced countries. This, thus, means that Africa is a suitable place for testing out this vision of the future.

Finally, Okamoto-san concludes that he hopes that the share value of Jumia goes many times over later on in the future.

This is all.

Thank you!
