Dear friends,

Today I'd like to share with you the next part of Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's lecture about the Japanese currency in relation to global affairs.

According to Okamoto-san's explanation, the value of the dollar is currently going up, while that of Japan as well as of South Korea are going down. On the other hand, for the other currencies that Okamoto-san also observes, such as the Swiss franc, the baht, the ringgit and the euro, it's actually the opposite, that is, the dollar is going down, while they're going up. For this reason, Okamoto-san thinks that from the point of view of the world, Japan and South Korea's currencies are becoming increasingly unreliable.

Finally, Okamoto-san believes that although Japan's economic situation is as though we're under water, waiting for the oxygen that will surely be refreshing, Okamoto-san hopes that the Japanese economy may soon turn for the better.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
