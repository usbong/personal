According to Okamoto-san, when he came to Malaysia seven years ago, the ringgit, the country's currency, had cost approximately 28 yen. However, these days, it costs 38 yen or more.

Given that the price of goods and services in Malaysia has also gone up, there are Japanese workers who are struggling in Malaysia.

Okamoto-san then explains the reason why the value of the Japanese currency is going down. 

One is the difference in the interest rate of the US dollar and the Japanese yen. It's thus advised to own dollars when its interest is high. It's also supposed that when the interest of the dollar goes down, that of the yen goes up. 

However, nowadays, this isn't the case, because the interest of the yen continues to decline. 

Okamoto-san thinks that the administration of Prime Minister Takaichi promotes a cheap yen. Okamoto-san explains that because of this, Japan could again strengthen its capability to export. Further, through this measure, the salary of Japanese workers goes up.

Still, Okamoto-san points out that to tell the truth, the salary couldn't go up as high, because the Japanese also need to import from overseas in order to build its infrastructures. Meanwhile, the price of goods continues to go up.

Next, Okamoto-san gives the example of a measure to help the population: Rice that is sold so cheap that it's said that the farmers don't make money. But this cannot be true, because a business ought to make money.

In addition, Okamoto-san talks about the Japanese manufacturing industry that sells to foreign countries. He also shares that when he had been in primary school decades ago, he learned that Japan is a major exporting country.

Further, he admits that when he had worked in the video games industry, he hadn't noticed at the start that the changes in the Japanese currency could have a significant impact on his company, which could do considerably well in spite of it, according to Okamoto-san.

Okamoto-san also shares that he had launched a mobile application, which gives him money all in yen, and he found out that he could enjoy his earnings more by living outside Japan. He thinks that if he continued to live in Japan, he wouldn't be able to notice the difference.

This is all. Of course, there are many more things that Okamoto-san has said, but we can continue with the lecture next time.

Thank you!
