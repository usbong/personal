Dear friends,

Today I'd like to share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about GungHo studio's most recent financial report.

According to the report, GungHo's sales have gone down 10% from the previous year to 93 billion yen, while its business profit has dropped 70% to only 5 billion yen, and its net profit has fallen 80% to 1.4 billion yen.

For these reasons, the studio has decided to move from mobile games to consoles or PC games. It seems that GungHo already feels the limits of the mobile market, such that it has to make this decision. However, Okamoto-san says that he thinks that the only game that GungHo was able to sell a lot of is Puzzle & Dragons, so he's worried that the studio is in a hurry to do so.

Further, Okamoto-san shares that last year was very difficult not only for GungHo but also for many studios in any line of work including subcontracting. Still, he prefers that GungHo strived more in the mobile market instead of move to another market.

Finally, Okamoto-san admits that he doesn't have all the information, and wants to listen to our data as well as opinions about this topic.

Therefore, let me say something about the Philippine studio Monstronauts, which launches mobile games that remind me of the Diner Dash genre.

I've never played Diner Dash, although I had heard about it when I was working in the same industry during the 2000s. I've also never downloaded Monstronauts' games, which include apps like the POTION PUNCH series. I think that people download these games, but only Google makes money by selling mobile phones that come with their software to both these developers who create their apps and the general users who want to use them. Nevertheless, studios get attention that helps them obtain subcontracting work if they want it.

This is all.

Thank you!

Regards,

Mike
