Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about food.

In particular, it's about the female YouTuber Ohgui-san who produced a negative sensation on the internet for not editing some parts of her video wherein she showed that after chewing the food, she'd spit it out.

Okamoto-san explains that the creators of these videos want to show that they can eat a lot, but, in the end, these are videos for entertainment. 

Also, given that the amount that Ohgui-san ate in her video was equivalent to four or five days' worth of Okamoto-san's food, of course, she cannot eat so much. Further, when we eat too much, we destroy our bodies and we become fat.

Finally, although there are people who'd say that these programs are fake, Okamoto-san believes that they are fiction, and asks us if fiction is bad for us.

In my opinion, it has to be made clear if the content is fiction or not.

This is all.

Thank you!

Regards,

Mike
