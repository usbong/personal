It's about the YouTuber (or "Influencer") Ms. Reika Miyazaki who is suspected of not paying Japanese government taxes costing 150 million yen.

Okamoto-san explains that the truth is that this amount is as high as what big Japanese studios in the video games industry pay.

In a public statement, Ms. Miyazaki apologizes, and says that her family isn't related to what she's done, something that Okamoto-san disagrees, because we'll need to know who has taught her to post on social media her high-class living, which includes possessions like, for example, her two luxury Ferrari cars.

Although the photos of these two Ferraris have disappeared from Ms. Miyazaki's account, in the end, she believes that there's no gray area, there's only black (or unequivocal). Furthermore, this area is divided into two more areas: white and another one, which really means the gray area that we understand.  

Finally, Okamoto-san concludes that a bad deed done, even in secret, will always get divulged afterward.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
