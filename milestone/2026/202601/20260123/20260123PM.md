This time, Okamoto-san answers questions from his viewers.

For example, there was one about whether Okamoto-san will launch a game for video game consoles.

Okamoto-san answers with a "No," and explains that to do so, which will include Steam as well, would cost him 60 million yen with the goal of earning 70 million yen. However, what he's willing to spend is only 10 to 15 million yen at the moment, so the size of the project is smaller, an indie game.

This is all. Of course, Okamoto-san shared with us much more, but I'll already need to stop here.

Thank you, and until next time!

Regards,

Mike
