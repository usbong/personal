Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about Nintendo Switch 2's performance in December of last year, and shares his prediction with respect to the studio's shares in the stock market.

First, Okamoto-san announces that the Switch 2's sales have gone down since December 2025.

He explains that when the console was launched for the first time, it was able to sell 3.5 million units in four days, an incredible achievement according to Okamoto-san.

However, although Okamoto-san has already bought three very well-known games from Nintendo for this console, he couldn't play them for more than a month, so he thinks that Nintendo needs a title that will make gamers buy the new Switch 2.

He gives as examples Mario Tennis or a new Zelda, whose Zelda series from Mr. Fujibayashi Hidemaro for the first Switch attracted gamers to buy the console.

He also points out that Pokémon couldn't attract gamers to buy the Switch 2 as much, because they can still play it in the first Switch. But if their consoles broke down, Okamoto-san thinks that it's better that they buy Switch 2.

Finally, Okamoto-san likes Nintendo a lot, and he isn't worried that the value of its shares would go down very much. In addition, given that Nintendo doesn't compete against PlayStation, Xbox or Steam, Okamoto-san hopes for the best future that the studio could bring to everyone.

This is all. 

Thank you!

Regards,
