Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's video last year and which he had just shared yesterday.

It's about his thoughts on the news that Nintendo's new Switch 2 has exceeded 10 million sold units.

He explains that at first he thought that Switch 2 still doesn't have a fantastic game that would actually attract buyers, but since Nintendo has stated that this console can run games for the first Switch as well, Okamoto-san is now interested.

In addition, Okamoto-san says that given that Switch breaks easily, instead of bringing it to Nintendo in order to ask the company to repair it, in fact, buyers can buy the new Switch 2 instead.

According to Okamoto-san, we should praise Nintendo for its prowess in marketing.

Furthermore, although Okamoto-san hopes that there may be a title that would use to the fullest the Switch 2's specs, he still thinks that among the three games that he's played and which include Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza and Kirby Air Riders, Donkey Kong Bananza is the one that he likes the most. 

However, he reveals that it isn't a game that he wants to play for a month or more. On other hand, Mario Kart World is a game that he goes back to play again from time to time, while the Kirby game is one that doesn't have the elements that he had enjoyed in its previous installment.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
