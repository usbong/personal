It's about the incident that occurred about a month ago in a Karaoke box in which a woman, in fact, a reporter from NTV, became drunk and another reporter from NHK took a photo of the scene. He posted it on social media and it received a lot of attention.

Okamoto-san explains that first he only has public information, and doesn't have those that haven't been divulged. Next, he says that the woman is currently giving the explanation that she doesn't recall what happened.

Okamoto-san doesn't believe in this excuse, because he thinks that there were other people with her as well when the incident occurred, so it's difficult to accept that these people also don't recall anything. He wonders: Were they also drunk when one of them had taken the photo?

Okamoto-san adds that men, even if drunk, don't do what the woman had done. Okamoto-san also points out that a security camera is put inside the Karoke box as a matter of course, so it would be possible to find out who's telling lies instead of the truth.

Finally, Okamoto-san supposes that perhaps this incident may be something that the woman and others do regularly.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
