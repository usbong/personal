In addition to Comugi-san's usual [news reports](https://dalab-dg.notion.site/2026-01-09-Weekly-Roundup-gm-2e399677e833805093a5d65f4a81c0e6), the presentation for the day was done by Mr. Yuki Uwaizumi, the Founder and CEO of Unyte.

Unyte is, to my mind, a startup fairly recently established in 2022 with a surprisingly small capital of 10.1 million yen with 20 people including contractual workers based in Tokyo.

The business focuses on building a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) community while providing related products and services.  

They've partnered with well-recognized companies that include Panasonic and Nissan, and do things similar to the R&D arm of big companies.  

An example of which is providing consulting work as well as tool and systems development assistance to Nissan on the "Nissan Passport." 

Participants who are able to take part in their Discord community on this project and complete certain tasks like doing coursework and graduating from school get to receive points. These points are then used to help employers, for instance, evaluate people. 

The overarching idea is that good people can do good things, so by actively participating in the community, helping out and sharing positivity with their fellow participants, it would be possible to clearly identify who have been active contributors.

All this information is stored using Blockchain Web3 technology, and their team's goal is to build a trustworthy platform where they provide various services that make use of personal data to help with employment and asset management, among other things.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
