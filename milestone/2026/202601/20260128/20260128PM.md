Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about the application for married couples who want to find another partner.

First, he says that he doesn't recommend this app to people, but given that some people online have said that they've been helped by it, Okamoto-san wants to share with us his thoughts.

He reveals that although it has a rule in which only married couples could use the app, Okamoto-san thinks that these couples do it in secret, that is, without telling their wife or husband.

Next, he points out that there are many reasons for which married couples would want to get into this type of app. For example, a husband may already be living life without having sex with his wife. Another may be that he wants women to notice him in order to feel happy. 

He also explains that if a husband has really met a partner through this app, the question is whether he can divulge it publicly or not. Okamoto-san thinks that it's better that the married spouse agrees with this outcome right from the start.

Further, Okamoto-san says that it's a market whose scale is in the 10 billion yen. On the other hand, maybe because of this, it's more prone to being used by bad-intentioned users, in which case Okamoto-san wants people to also think about the risks.

Finally, Okamoto-san concludes that if married couples use it, they should get the permission of their wife or husband.

This is all. 

Thank you!
