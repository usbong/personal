In this video, Okamoto-san announces that he's invested 600 million yen in a durian plantation.

Furthermore, he says that the durian from Malaysia is well-known for being the most delicious in the world. In fact, the one that he's holding in his hand is the durian from Malaysia itself, which is also his favorite to eat, especially after eating lunch.

This is all.

Thank you!

Regards,

Mike
