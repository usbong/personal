Okamoto-san likes very much the anime, which he watched on Netflix. After seeing the anime, he tried out its video game as well. He says that although he's only been able to finish the tutorial of the game, it made him interested in viewing the next season of the anime, which is Season 2. He doesn't want to divulge the story yet in order to avoid revealing any spoilers, but he admits that he's seen all its episodes, and he gives it a recommendable rating.

Meanwhile, he still plays its game without putting any money, and he says that he'd want to ask our opinions regarding this matter.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
