Okamoto-san has observed that recently there have been many incidents involving foreigners and their customs, which aren't really part of Japanese customs. Moreover, he says that after deciding to live in Japan, they should already be following the rules of the country.

Okamoto-san points out his decision to live in Malaysia where drivers don't obey traffic signs, the waiters only talk among themselves, even though there are customers waiting at the door, among many things that don't happen in Japan at all. 

However, because he wants to live in Malaysia, he doesn't consider them huge problems. In fact, he's now been living in the country for seven and a half years.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
