It was actually a live video and since I've written something about the first part of his talk, this time, the part that I'm going to focus on is his answer about the game Dragon Quest Walk.

He reveals that the developer, COLOPL, is in a difficult situation, because it must lay off 70 workers, a decision chosen by its shareholders.

Okamoto-san explains that although the Dragon Quest game doesn't have any financial problems, the studio has other projects that it has to terminate. In addition, given that the workers, who aren't highly skilled, would, of course, be unable to move to another studio easily, the developer has to help them find another place to work.

Okamoto-san points out that it's completely different with the management style in the U.S., where it's faster to layoff workers, but since this isn't so in Japan, studios must follow the country's labor laws.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
