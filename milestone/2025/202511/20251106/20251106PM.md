Okamoto-san says that the Starbucks coffee shop is a very well-known brand in South Korea. Actually, in nine years, it has doubled the number of its stores in the country.

However, it has a big problem.

For example, customers are in the store for up to 11 hours, and some go to another store to eat.

Moreover, there are people who bring a partition or a printer to the store, bothering other customers.

Finally, Okamoto-san advises staying in the store for only up to 1.5 hours, and suggests another place, the library, for studying.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
