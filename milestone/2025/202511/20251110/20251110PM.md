First, he announces that the value of the shares of the company gumi has gone up 30%, and Okamoto-san has sold all his shares to earn 20% in total. Previously, he said that he had made a big mistake in investing in gumi, because he lost 10%. But now he's very happy for this outcome, and plans to invest again in the U.S. stock market, which, he believes, has shares whose values could rise up to 50%.

Specifically, he's talking about Microsoft, which he wants to invest in again, and Micron Technology, whose value is going up so clearly that Okamoto-san wants to invest in this company.

Okamoto-san explains that after the value of stocks goes down, they gradually go up again, and there's a point when they've gone up high enough, and we'd want to sell.

Furthermore, he says that he hopes that the people who've bought his stocks are satisfied as well.

Right now, Okamoto-san wants to invest a million USD in the US stock market.

Before ending, Okamoto-san reveals that a companion of his has asked him if wants to invest more in his durian plantation. Therefore, Okamoto-san has to consider which places he wants to invest in with his money, which he now has a lot of in cash.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
