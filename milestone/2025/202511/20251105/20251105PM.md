More specifically, he focuses on the driving exams that allow foreigners to pass them with low marks like 7 out of 10, even though the Japanese themselves are supposed to get higher marks like 90 out of 100 questions during the time of Okamoto-san.

Also, he explains that in Malaysia when the price of petroleum increased, affecting in particular foreigners, because only citizens receive extra financial help from the Malaysian government, Okamoto-san accepted it. He says that it's because he wants to continue to live in the country.

Finally, he points out that the Japanese government allows these said treatments, because most likely there are people who receive bribes. 

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
