It's a version of the popular game that's become a classic for the genre. Moreover, for 15 years, the game has been captivating gamers through its Gatcha component wherein the player could put in 300 yen to receive a gift.

Okamoto-san reveals that he's bought and played the game, but he doesn't think that he'd put a lot of money into it. However, for a long time, the game still continues to be available to everyone, something that surprised Okamoto-san.

Also, upon starting a campaign, the player basically needs around four months to finish it. Still, according to Okamoto-san, this duration has gradually become longer. In addition, right now, there are as much as 200 alliances in the game, and Okamoto-san invites its players to add him. His account name is: sarukichi ichi go (さるきち１号)

Finally, he says that he wants to learn more about the game's Gatcha mechanism, which helps both young and old players be able to enjoy it by putting money into the game.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
