Dear friends,

It's about the way to regain the "Sense of Wonder."

First, Fukuoka-sensei says that the goal of this event is to revitalize the reading of books. He explains that nowadays the number of people who read books has gone down significantly, but he hopes that through this event, more people would want to read them. Also, he points out that he believes that we'll never lose books.

Next, he says that the book is a way of binding a portion of time. Furthermore, this time can be a part of the writer's life, a history of human beings or a history of the life of the world. So the book is really a compilation of a story.

Finally, Fukuoka-sensei hopes that we could enjoy books. 

Of course, what I've written here is only the introduction of Fukuoka-sensei's entire talk. In fact, he had also invited several writers to share three books and tell when and in what way they had read them. Moreover, he asks them what sort of influence the authors of the books have had on them.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
