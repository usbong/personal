He says that the game will have a program that'll be released on Netflix, and Okamoto-san is very happy, because he likes the game so much.

He explains that it's set in the island called Catan, where hexagonal tiles are used. Furthermore, the resources vary depending on the region in the island.

More specifically, the resources include metal, wheat, sheep wool, wood and brick. Also, through these resources, players could build roads, new areas and cities within the island.

Although all the players are working toward the development of the island, each one is striving to develop it more than the others. They can also negotiate with another player, but as what Okamoto-san explains, each person could be preparing to betray the other.

However, its game developers believe that while initially it seems that the cunning player would win, the rest of the players could still turn around this sitation in the end.

Finally, Okamoto-san believes that boardgames will be very popular in the coming years, and he hopes that we could also try out Catan for ourselves.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
