He says that although many people say that they're already making a lot of effort, the truth is that we should also add the part about the goal that we'd want to achieve.

Okamoto-san points out that the word, "Effort," doesn't only mean the result, because what's more important is to achieve our goal.

He gives the example from his own life. He says that actually he has many regrets, and if he could go back to that point in time when he was 20 years old, he'd strive even harder.

He reveals that it's because he had preferred to take the more convenient path, such that at times what he was able to achieve was only 60% of his goal.

Therefore, in summary, let's all strive to achieve 100% of our goals.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
