Dear friends,

Today let me share with you a video of Resident Evil 2: Dead Shot (Bandai Namco) from channel Arcade Heroes, who is again sharing with us footages of the game.

It particularly attracted me, because I'm a fan of Time Crisis in the arcades during the 90s, and I wanted to see this new release from Bandai Namco, which makes use of the Resident Evil franchise. 

The truth is that when I saw it for the first time, just like this time, I thought that I won't be able to last for several minutes with only one token and without putting in more money.

I think that it's because as a newbie, who's still really only a spectator of the game, it seems to me that I should first know more about the game including what would happen in it.

I recall that CAPCOM's DND was also an arcade game that I wanted to try out and play as the magicuser character, but at that time I also thought that I wouldn't last for very long with only one token.

Finally, I'd like to also share with you this PlayStation game. It's called MediEvil that I myself wanted to play, but focused on other things instead. However, my younger brother was able to finish it, even though the videos that we can now view on the internet show that the camera hadn't been done very well, among other things.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
