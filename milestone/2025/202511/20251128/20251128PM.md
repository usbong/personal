As usual, Comugi-san began with his news reports about cryptocurrencies, particularly, Bitcoin, whose value recently has gone down dramatically.

Joi-sensei explains that it seems that it's because the investors who do data mining concerning the movements of Bitcoin transactions have decided to convert their data center for Bitcoin to one for AI that also uses GPU, something that they've asked for when they built the said data center.

Next, Comugi-san also shares the news that the Crypto Spells service, along with its trading card game that uses Blockchain technology, is shutting down. He, therefore, points out that the industry isn't doing well at the moment. 

In addition, Comugi-san says that virtual currency has been approved by the Federal Security Agency (FSA) and will become a commercial product. This is why he says that it's getting more regulated in order to protect against insider training, among others.

Finally, for the main presentation, Comugi-san talks about the prediction market, beginning with an article from Financial Times about the threat to democracy from this technology that can predict the results of the elections.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
