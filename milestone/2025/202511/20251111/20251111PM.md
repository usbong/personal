He says that while many entrepreneurs have launched new businesses using AI, the truth is that 80% say that it isn't useful.

However, Prof. Joi points out that when Google Docs itself was launched, people at the time didn't believe that it was possible using Javascript. Prof. Ito reveals that Google Docs' key developer is going to Japan to work with Prof. Joi's team.

So, although enthusiasm for AI has diminished, Prof. Joi believes that it'll rise again even further from hereon.

More specifically, he gives the example of a tool being developed by Microsoft called Amplifier. Although it's still not simple to use for ordinary people, it helps users by giving comments about the programs that they've written or rewrite these programs itself.

In addition, something curious is that each member of this project's core team doesn't comprehend nor write any code at all. Prof. Joi says that before, students, who could write software well, became the programmers. But this time, the president or the section chief can now create programs easily by himself. This is because now the question isn't what syntax is correct, but what project do you want to do.

Therefore, Prof. Joi is very excited for this progress in AI and the many more that could occur in the coming future.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
