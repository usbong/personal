But before beginning with his talk, he shares with us that he wanted to record the video outside the usual venue, and since his companions also agreed, they went to a coffee shop that has the Starbucks logo.

Now, this release from Konami called "WAI WAI WORLD (Crazy World" is a new service that allows users to take advantage of the studio's characters in order to create new games that they can share or play with other people.

Okamoto-san says that around 30 years ago, he had also thought about launching a tool to adjust the settings of Street Fighter with the goal of creating the most powerful fighter, although, in the end, he decided not to release it. 

He says that it's because another studio might use the tool in its own fighting game. He also foresaw the issue of balance with respect to the gameplay, which won't anymore be like the core of jankenpoy (rock, paper, scissors).

Finally, he says that this game will be better if there's a good mechanism to put money into it, because he points out that developers earn more in this way.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
