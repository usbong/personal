Okamoto-san says that the value of the studio has gone up so much that he wanted to know the reason for the movement, which seems unnatural. 

He reveals that the "Murakami Fund" has bought plenty of the studio's shares, and has become the owner with the most shares. Moreover, the daughter of Murakami-san has been given a position at the studio, helping out in the work at DeNA.

In summary, Okamoto-san has shared with us an example of something that influences the value of the shares of a company. Therefore, let's all learn to understand these things as well.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
