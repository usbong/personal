He explained that it was for his mother whom he wanted to give this gift. Moreover, it had been for four days and three nights (If I had understood correctly) and cost 4 million yen per person, so a million yen per day.

Also, there were three delicious meals every day and the sake could be drunk limitlessly. The room in the train had a bathroom and, in the case of Okamoto-san and his mother, they had the largest. He pointed out that they had won it as a prize, because, as explained by Okamoto-san to Ms. Tapi, he had asked the tourist company several times to give them the said room.

In addition, he said that they met other tourists in this journey. For example, there was a pair in their 60s who had retired, and in addition two women in their 40s.

Finally, Okamoto-san thinks that it was a magnificent gift for his mother.

This is all.

Thank you.
