First, he says that right now he has a throat problem, so he apologizes if we aren't able to understand well what he'd say.

Next, he introduces to us Mamon King, a game that's been created by [Yoshinama-san](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEnkd5D-53MDGpgpiQRbUqw), a YouTuber who releases videos where he demonstrates various games. Okamoto-san says that he started doing this since 2015 and he currently has 1.04 million subscribers.

Furthermore, his new game is about raising monsters that fight other monsters. Okamoto-san admits that it doesn't seem to be very interesting at first, because there are only 37 monsters and its creator has put only 25 million yen into the production of the game.

Okamoto-san explains that nowadays milliones of yen are needed to create video games, so he thought that this game from Yoshinama-san is an indie type of game, that is, something small-scale.

However, after checking it out some more, he found that from Yoshinama-san's videos, it seemed to Okamoto-san that Yoshinama-san isn't lying based on his facial expressions, especially when he said that he believes that his new game is actually really interesting.

Therefore, Okamoto-san will buy the game, also indicating that it will be launched on December 11, 2025 for 1480 yen (or with 35% discount, 962 yen) for Nintendo Switch, PC and Steam.

He also points out that if this game becomes very popular, he foresees that it'll have more updates. Okamoto-san believes that it has the possibility to become popular for a generation. Moreover, he explains that this type of game focuses on a specific market, and if we're also interested, he advises us to try it out. But if not, it's also all right.

Finally, Okamoto-san concludes that he likes games from a non-action-based genre, where our character becomes stronger upon putting in the time.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
