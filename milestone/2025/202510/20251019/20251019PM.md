Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about the news that Electronic Arts (EA), one of the most well-known video game publishers in the world, with famous titles like, for example, Battlefield and FIFA, has been bought by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), a fund connected to the government of Saudi Arabia.

Okamoto-san shares with us that PIF would pay 8.2 trillion yen (approx. 4.1 trillion PHP) to acquire the studio. This valuation includes the 25% that PIF has added to the price of each share of the said studio. Moreover, it won't be changing the studio's management, and will make it a private establishment. 

Okamoto-san explains that it's so that PIF would have the power to control the direction of the studio, which, Okamoto-san believes, is related to esports.

Okamoto-san also reveals that actually PIF already posses 10% of the shares of well-known studios in the world, including Nintendo.

Finally, he expects more improvements to come to the video game industry in the coming years because of this great step forward.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
