First, he explains that investing gives him the same feeling as what he says is like playing in the casino. He admits that it's very fun to win in this way, although it's also difficult to continue winning.

He says that he had previously committed a 10 million yen blunder by investing in the company, gumi, but since he had also invested in another company called klab, he was able to recuperate the money with its interest of 16% to 20% (current).

Right now, he owns shares of klab (100 million yen), CyberAgent (100 million yen) and Nintendo (300 million yen) amounting to a total of 500 million yen.

Moreover, he's invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum, although the value of these cryptocurrencies is currently falling by 5%. Still, Okamoto-san believes that afterward, the value will surely rise again.

He also reveals that although he had invested every month in Vanguard, a platform like S&P500, he's temporarily stopped doing this two or three months ago. However, he thinks about returning to investing in it again.

Finally, he shares that investing requires the understanding of economics and politics, among others, and he hopes that we don't lose a lot of money doing it as well.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
