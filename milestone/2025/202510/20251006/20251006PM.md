Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Prof. Shinichi Fukuoka's lecture in 2019, and which was released on YouTube two weeks ago.

Fukuoka-sensei begins with a story about butterflies, which, he says, use the back portion of their wings to defend themselves, because it adapts itself to the environment. We know that people show the front part instead of the back to hide ulterior motives.

Next, Fukuoka-sensei shares that he had met Mr. Ryuichi Sakamato in the U.S. several times before the latter's death, and he says that their conversations when they met had been very serious.

During that time, Sakamoto-san had been battling cancer, and here Fukuoka-sensei explains that actually there are many ways to treat it. 

For example, the malignant organ can be removed through surgery or the patient's immune system can be strengthened.

In this part, I remembered Norman Cousins who wrote about the efficacy of Vitamin C to solve the said disease. We know, however, that the human body cannot absorb the vitamin too much and that it would only excrete it afterward.

Finally, there's the "atomic bomb," which destroys not only the cancer cells but also the healthy ones.

Of course, Fukuoka-sensei spoke about many more things, but I should already stop here.

Thank you.

Regards,
