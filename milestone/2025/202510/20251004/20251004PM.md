Okamoto-san explains that among the recent consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, the Nintendo Switch 2 specializes as before in gameplay instead of the graphics. However, Okamoto-san thinks that players should still wait a bit more for its iconic games to be released.

On the other hand, Sony and Microsoft also need more time to launch their next consoles, because it seems that they don't have anything that will take advantage of its specs. Actually, even the PlayStation 5 doesn't have the game for its technology that would get the gamers who've bought it to want to play. Okamoto-san gives the example of Monster Hunter Wilds, but says that the full capability of the console isn't yet utilized. Therefore, Okamoto-san foresees that we'll have up to five years to wait for this new game.

Meanwhile, titles exclusive to the PlayStation are coming to Steam, and the PC's specs are attaining very quicky the specs of the PlayStation 5, which is supposed to be the most advanced console.

Finally, Okamoto-san doesn't know what game will result from this, but he's excited for the outcome and says that he'll continue to buy new consoles even after retiring. 

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
