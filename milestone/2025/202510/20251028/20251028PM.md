Dear friends,

Today let me share with you a video from Bots and Books, a channel that I've just recently discovered.

In the video, we can hear about the general idea including the layout of the content of every page of a magazine.

I think it's informative, although if we want more details like, for example, how to become the Editor-in-Chief of a magazine, we should read the article in the page itself. Also, sometimes, there's not much information available about the game, and it may mean that we should really play to understand.

Finally, I'd like to highlight page 201 of the magazine where Wolf Fang (SS 2001) was presented. It's a game where the player customizes his own mech robot. 

The word "strategic" reminded me of Mechwarrior, a PC game, which I had tried out with my siblings. It was quite interesting, because it was about robots and we had to fight against other robots as well, while riding one. However, it was too slow to move the robot, and I thought that the fights didn't come quickly. So we played the game, Theme Park, from Bullfrog instead. 

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
