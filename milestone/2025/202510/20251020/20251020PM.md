Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about his thoughts on the labor system that the Japanese government has created for the present era.

First, he says that he began working during the Showa Period and says that there was a system called totei seido or decchi koukou that allowed a neophyte to learn the master's techniques by working with him. 

In addition, although he didn't receive any salary, he worked with the master and ate the master's food, among others. After several years, the neophyte could go to another master to learn more.

Okamoto-san explains that a long time ago, 90% of video games had been created by the Japanese, but nowadays more of these games are being created by developers from other countries. So although Okamoto-san doesn't know if there's anyone who'd want more Japanese weaklings, when he was much younger, in order to achieve the objectives of their project, he had worked in the evening as well. 

And while he didn't receive any overtime pay, he continued working, because he felt very satisfied with his tasks. Moreover, his bosses had given him a bonbon bed in the office and asked him if he also wanted a sauna.

Finally, Okamoto-san believes that the current labor system in Japan doesn't allow workers to experience what he had experienced, therefore, it's questionable if there'll be more good games coming from Japan in the future.

This is all.

Thank you.
