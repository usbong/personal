> 歩くだけで環境に貢献！？aoraが展開するポイ活アプリ"Pucre (プクレ)"とは？｜今週のweb3ニュースまとめ｜weekly gm｜2025年10月17

More concretely, the company aora has created an application called "Pucre," which gives its users points whenever they walk, or do activities related to the entertainment industry like, for example, listening to music. 

Although it's not yet clear how these points will be used specifically later on, the goal is that a person can contribute to the environment by doing their daily activities.

Also, the presenters explain that it's really difficult to continue contributing to the environment via current pathways. This is why the company has created this step in the process so that people may contribute through the daily tasks that they enjoy doing.

Moreover, much later, they want to link this initiative with well-known titles in the video game industry. Mr. Makoto Haga, in particular, mentioned the Pokémon Collectible Trading Card game as well as the Dragon Quest franchise.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
