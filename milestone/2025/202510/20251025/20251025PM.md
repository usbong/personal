He explains that he bought it five years ago in 2020 when it cost 250 million yen (approx. 125 million PHP). A rich person had advised him to own 10% of his money in gold, because its value would rise three times. So 250 million would go up to 830 million yen after considering that the value of the Japanese currency would also go down.

Furthermore, Okamoto-san says that the value of gold goes down dramatically after rising like a wave, and he believes that it's better to buy it when it's cheap. He teaches that it's important to have cash as well in case we need the money.

Okamoto-san admits that he wasn't sure at first how many kilograms of gold he'd sell, but in the end he decided to sell all of the 37 kg of gold that now cost more than double the 250 million yen. He explains that the amount in yen is quite high, because the value of the Japanese currency has gone down more throughout the years.

Finally, he reveals that it's a unique experience to own gold in this way, because the truth is that there's also what is called "paper gold."

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
