It's about the profit that a person can gain by investing in stocks or real estate.

He explains that in Japan it's said that people who don't invest in stocks won't many plenty of money. This is because taxes increase with the rise in income. For example, a 100 million yen income will have around 50% tax. However, the tax for stocks is only 20%. It's a lot cheaper than in real estate, where around 50% is imposed.

Moreover, in Malaysia, the rules of the country allow people to take all the income from stocks without paying any tax. The most tax that has to be paid in Malaysia is only 29% of the capital gain.

On the other hand, in Japan, the government is adding more taxes after accepting foreigners into the country.

Finally, Okamoto-san prefers not to be required to pay taxes, and believes that more people would want to live in the country if it were so.

This is all.

Thank you.
