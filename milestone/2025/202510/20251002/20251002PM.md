Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about his decision to convert almost all of his company shares into cash.

Okamoto-san explains that due to the wars in Europe and the Middle East, he feels scared of World War III, even though given that he lives in Malaysia, if it does occur, he believes that it won't reach him there. But because of this, he thinks that his shares in the U.S. and even the Japanese markets won't rise as much as other people expect.

Also, he's grateful that the tax in Japan when a person sells his shares is only 20.135%, and, in addition, he understands that he doesn't need to pay taxes to the Malaysian government. Therefore, he wants to exchange his shares for cash.

Moreover, he explains that he's stopped his daily activities on S&P in order to transfer his money to the ETF of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which, he says, he owns a few.

Next, he says that since he still believes that his shares in Unity will go up some more, he wants to continue keeping them. However, he reveals that they're still not rising as expected.  

So Okamoto-san says that he still owns shares, because he likes the feeling of winning several times over, but doesn't recommend everyone to do this with excessively high amounts of money.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
