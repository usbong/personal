Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about the mobile market, which he believes is a "Blue Ocean." It's a concept that means that the apps that get released will dominate the market.

Specifically, he focuses on the genre called location-based games.

Moreover, he talks about studio Colopl whose game called Colony Seikatsu (Space Colony Life) was one that he had played in his secondary job. He says that it was fantastic, particularly the aspect of administering various objects found in the game.

Afterward, he played Dragon Quest Walk, Pikmin Bloom, Pokémon Go and Monster Hunter Now. 

Furthermore, he says that there's a game called "Odekake silk road" that can be found in the Colopl platform, where 70 or 80% of users continue to play it. Okamoto-san explains that in general after a month, only 20% of users remain, and after a year, only 10%.

Okamoto-san also emphasizes that the game makes players want to play it right after doing another task unrelated to the game, thereby making it really difficult to quit playing.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
