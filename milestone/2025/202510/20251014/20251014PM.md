First, he says that he doesn't have any intention to sell the ROLEX watches that he buys. Moreover, he says that he's received as a gift from his subordinate one of the models called Diver's Watch Submariner for his birthday 10 years ago, and he recalls that it had valued around 800,000 yen (approx. 400,000 PHP), but later its value went up to as much as 3.3 million yen (approx. 1.65 million PHP).

Therefore, he explains that the value of a ROLEX watch that's been bought in its official store, that is, not a "tenbaiya" store that sells used watches, would go up throughout the years.

Next, he says that in a 007 film, a scene was shown where the hero put on a military uniform and dived in order to infiltrate the base of the enemy. After removing his diving suit, it was revealed that he had a Submariner watch.

Finally, Okamoto-san shares several things that we shouldn't forget. For example, shampoo removes the grease involved in the mechanism of the watch. In addition, he tells of two incidents when he had gone to the onsen, and his ROLEX watch had been robbed in those two occasions.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
