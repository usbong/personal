Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about the reason why games for grown-ups are very popular.

First, he says that the phrase, "The gamer gene," seems to be not suitable in explaining this result.

Moreover, given that people would feel secure when things, which they initially didn't understand, are explained, Okamoto-san gives some data ("The genetics of gaming: A longitudinal twin study," ACAMH), which indicate that boys from 9 to 18 years old play more each day than girls, who little by little prefer not to play anymore.

Okamoto-san explains that it's because more games with themes like war are really for boys, and that if there were more games created for girls, he thinks that this market would be quite huge as well.

Finally, since there aren't much data about female gamers yet and Okamoto-san himself doesn't completely understand which game would be suitable for girls, he advises us to write our comments about this topic.

Therefore, I'd like to respond with three games, which I remember that my sister had played when she began to play during the PlayStation era: PoyPoy, Harvest Moon and Monster Rancher.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
