Dear friends,

Today I'd like to share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about Cygames, a company that has released a new game called Shadowverse for mobile devices wherein players make use of cards to launch an attack, among other actions.

According to Okamoto-san, the truth is that there are already many mobile applications in Japan, but it seems to him that the company, Cygames, is at the top of those who make them, particularly because its game is the most downloaded today.

Further, when Okamoto-san tried it out, it was a little complicated for newbies like himself, but he found that there are actually players who've been playing it continuously. He also emphasizes the graphics and the animations of its characters, which he believes are high quality assets.

Okamoto-san says that he'd like to buy more stocks of the company which is actually part of a larger company that is CyberAgent, though he points out that its other service that is Abema TV that he attracts him more. The service had originally been unable to make money, but has since already made earnings recently.

For this reason, he advises everyone who wants to invest in the company that the value of its stocks are rising.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
