> モンハンNowストーリー☆9攻略［☆10解放への道-後編-］｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 66

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto has shared with us a new Monster Hunter NOW (MHN) gameplay video. This time, he's teaching us some of the techniques that we can use to hunt several monsters that inhabit the world of MHN. For example, we should wait for the monster to attack and evade it once it comes to lunge at us. Afterward, we continue to fire bullets at the monster.

While I stopped at 40% of the video, and have not seen the entirety of it yet, I'd like to share with you some of my observations.

First, the face of the monster called "Magaimagado" reminded me of "Papa Meow," one of the cats at our household. Further, this monster's movement is just like a cat, and so we can imagine that the developers were trying to show us a kind of 3D gameplay that we can enjoy with these animals. Also, they've added weapons that we cannot use to hurt animals in real life.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
