> 金銭トラブルが原因の女性刺〇事件に思うこと|岡本吉起塾ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us his thoughts about a type of incident that has been occurring recently. It involves a woman and an older man whom the woman murders due to problems with money.

According to Okamoto-san, older men sometimes dream about going out on a date with a beautiful woman, so that they'd even be willing to pay large amounts of money just to be able to go out with her.

Okamoto-san further explains that the money that the woman gets from the man is often misconstrued as being given to her when in fact it should be returned to the man afterward.

Okamoto-san then points out that an overweight man has the least chance of being together with a beautiful woman.

Finally, given that this type of incident has been occurring recently, he advises everyone to take care.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
