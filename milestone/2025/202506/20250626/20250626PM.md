> 堀井雄二さん監修のすごろくゲームを開発中と発表した謎多きゲーム会社『Any』が気になる！

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is talking about a new game that makes its players get into a fight with each other.

Actually, he says that it's not the type of game that he'd continue to play, but since Master Yuji Horii of Dragon Quest fame as well as Mr. Muneyuki Kaneshiro of Blue Rock are providing guidance to this project, it has caught Mr. Okamoto's attention.

Also, the president of the company is a woman by name of Ms. Ayaka Sato, someone who's not too well-known in the industry. But the project is already slated for release next year, and we can assume that it has already secured funding, even though its source isn't quite clear.

Finally, Mr. Okamoto is happy that such things are possible in the video games industry.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
