Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us an AI matching app that gives guys the opportunity to date a woman, which the AI has selected for them.

Okamoto-san says that he thinks that the algorithm of this app is problematic. He explains that even though it asks the male user several questions about the woman that he wants, there's no way to prioritize which answers are more important for him than others. This is why many men have said that they didn't want to meet the woman that the AI picked for them at all.

Furthermore, since there's been quite a lot of these men who cancel their dates at the last minute, a rule has been created so that the guy has to pay money for canceling and wasting the woman's time.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
