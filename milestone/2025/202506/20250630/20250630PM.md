> 面倒なやり取り不要なAIマッチングアプリって実際どうなん？｜岡本吉起塾CH

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us an AI matching app that enables a guy to date a woman, which the AI has selected for him.

Okamoto-san says that he thinks that the algorithm of this app has problems. He explains that even though it asks the male user several questions about the woman that he wants, there's no way to prioritize which answers are more important for him than others. This is why many men have said that they didn't want to meet the woman that the AI picked for them at all.

Furthermore, since there's been quite a lot of these men who cancel their dates at the last minute, a rule has been created so that the guy has to pay money for cancelling at the last minute and wasting the woman's time.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
