> 【大バズり】マリオ映画が世界的大ヒット！今ゲーム作品の映画化の波が来てるで！

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us his thoughts about the global box office hit, The Super Mario Bros. The Movie.

Okamoto-san says that the flick has earned 1.3 billion dollars worldwide, and ranks 18th in Japan's best-selling anime of all time in the Japanese domestic market.

However, movie critics have commented that the film isn't really too interesting, while viewers, on the other hand, have said that it was actually very remarkable.

Okamoto-san explains that whenever a film uses a video game brand, it brings with it things that viewers could recognize from the game. This makes the film a lot more meaningful and also funnier, though on the flipside, its jokes and story elements may be a lot harder to comprehend especially for those who haven't played the game before.

This is all.

Of course, Okamoto-san said more, but I'll need to stop here right now, otherwise my letter would be too long.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
