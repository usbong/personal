Okamoto-san says that it's different from the interest we receive from the deposits we put in our savings account in the bank.

We get more out of investing in stocks, because it has a snowball effect, that is, the money grows larger and larger. For example, in 10 years, an investor can make 40% profit, while in 20 years, it goes up to 240%.

Moreover, Okamoto-san points out that even though he respects the Japanese system, he believes that each person still has to make an individual effort to invest their money. He says that there's a family in Japan that's so poor that they couldn't even eat onigiri rice balls.

Finally, the pension that senior citizens later receive is something that young people is supposed to think about when they spend money, like a guide that says what the maximum amount for spending money is. However, for Okamoto-san, this amount is too small.

This is all.

Thank you.
