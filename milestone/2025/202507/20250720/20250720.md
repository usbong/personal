Dear friends,

Today let me share with you two things.

One is about the new video from Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto wherein we can see him hunting down with his companions two great monsters from the world of Monster Hunter NOW.

My next story is about one of the three boxing matches that took place in MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas last July 20 (Philippine Time). Boxer Manny Pacquiao had also gone out to fight, but this time, I'd like to focus on the fight between Isaac Cruz and Omar Salcido.

In Okamoto-san's video, he and his three companions were able to capture the monsters called "Jinouga" and "Rioreia."

He says that he knows well his companions and they also him so that it was easy to succeed. I also found that while not all, there are movements that 3D objects make which can amaze us, particularly those from the Rioreia with its wings.

A while ago, I went to the Sta. Lucia Mall to find out the reason why my computer doesn't have sound when I'm not using the HDMI cable. The shopkeeper explained to me that I can only use the back part of my computer and not the front for the sound. There are now more clouds that cover the screen of my Sony Bravia HD monitor, and I think that I can change it for a spare one though it would only have VGA without HDMI.

But what I'd really want to share with you is that when I was there at the mall, I was able to watch the fight between these two Mexicans, Cruz and Salcido, on TV, which received the broadcast from GMA7. 

I think that we can understand more the concept of sports and entertainment through their fight. That is, if the other boxer can no longer fight, he'll signal this to his opponent, and they'll go create several scenes that we can recognize from other famous boxers and we can comment that the both of them had a good fight. Of course, the loser should still have a beaten up face.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
