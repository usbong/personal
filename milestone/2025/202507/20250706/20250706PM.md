> MARVELの格闘ゲーム発表!!?『マーベル闘魂 ファイティングソウルズ』映像レビュー！ 

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us his review of the new "Marvel Fighting Souls" video game trailer.

First of all, it's a fighting game being developed by Arc System Works, a company which, as you all may know, was founded by Mr. Minoru Kidooka, a former engineer at Sega.

Okamoto-san says that having the license of a brand like "Marvel" entails more work, because the developers would have to make sure that the gameplay aspect of the game doesn't suffer while respecting the brand. In other words, the development team has to work a lot harder and put in a lot more effort into making the game.

Moreover, since it's a 4 vs 4 fighting game, meaning that each team would have four members, Okamoto-san expects that it's going to be super chaotic, and that a player may end up focusing only on one member of the team and shun the rest.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
