> 海外移住者って株主優待制度は利用出来る？│岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us the idea of preferential treament that stockholders of Japanese companies are able to enjoy.

First, he says that in Japan stockholders are given gifts like special food or tickets to amusement parks. He explains that the system encourages investors to put their money into several companies, because if a stockholder, for instance, owns 100 stocks, he'd already get a present from the company, and in order to get another present from the same company, he'd need to own 1,000 stocks.

Furthermore, right now, Okamoto-san is thinking about buying the stocks of Oriental Land. He says that its stock price is currently cheap and he foresees that it's going to go up later on. He provides three reasons for this. 

First, its hotels are very expensive. Second, the company is able to sell a lot of souvenir items, and finally, they've introduced a special ticket similar to Disney's Premium Access, which lets visitors shorten the amount of time they need to wait in order to enjoy a rollercoaster ride, among other attractions.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
