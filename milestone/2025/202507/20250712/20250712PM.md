Dear friends,

Today I'd like to share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk with Panchu-san on the new collaboration between Final Fantasy and Magic The Gathering (FF x MTG).

Panchu-san explains what he does in terms of playing and collecting the cards of the game.

First of all, he's an employee of studio Derage, which is a company associated with Okamoto-san's team. In addition, he has since before been playing MTG.

Of course, he knows the FF characters who include those from FFI to FFXVI and appear in several of the cards. Also, he says that the same character can have several illustrations, for instance, one made by Master Yoshitaka Amano, and another by a foreign illustrator.

However, as with the collaboration between MTG and Lord of The Rings, there's a card that is unique, and in this case, it's The Ring, which had been sold for 300 million yen (approx. 150 million pesos). A musician overseas had bought it, according to Panchu-san.

Meanwhile, he continues to play MTG, although he sells the rare cards that he obtains from the packs that he buys. For this reason, he plays using cards that are inexpensive. He knows that there are players who, because they participate in tournaments, need the rare cards.

Moreover, he collects cards that have been illustrated by Master Amano, and says that there are about 20 cards that he likes from the master. Right now, he has one that has already been signed by the master.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
