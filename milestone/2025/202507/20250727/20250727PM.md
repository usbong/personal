He showed us photos and videos of the venue where the SF6 esports tournament was held as well as his meeting with the Prime Minister of Morocco who also attended the event.

Moreover, he spoke about the time when he began working in the video game industry 43 years ago. At the time, he said, video games weren't yet part of people's lives. 

Furthermore, he pointed out that because Morocco today is just like Japan in those days in that it has many startups, events, and young people with energy, the country has all the conditions necessary to become a great video game powerhouse.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
