Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is talking about the "Peace Boat," a type of advertisement that is posted inside Japanese bars to recruit people to join in cruise trips.

Okamoto-san says that after retiring, one thing he wants to do is to go on a cruise around the world. However, he admits that he doesn't really like the movement of the ship at sea, because it makes him dizzy.

He notes that several years ago, there was a news report where a woman with the surname of "Tsujimoto," complained so much about these advertisements that Okamoto-san didn't want to join the trips anymore. Incidentally, the woman's surname is the same as the Capcom president's, though they're not related to each other. 

Okamoto-san also gives an example where although the price of the ticket had been set beforehand, the person later finds out that if he wanted to access the internet, he'd need to pay another fee, which adds up to over a million yen for 100 days. Okamoto-san thinks that this is too much.

Another is that while the other travelers are also Japanese, at times, the person is grouped with the type of tourist whom he doesn't like.

Finally, Okamoto-san says that this experience might not be exactly the same as his viewers', so he encourages them to write about their thoughts in the comments section.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
