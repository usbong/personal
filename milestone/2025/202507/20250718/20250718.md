Dear friends,

Today let me share with you the YouTube Live video of Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto and team who explain that investing isn't playing games in the casino.

He admits that the task tires him, and in fact he has lost millions of yen, although he points out that the value of these stocks go down and up like the waves of the sea. Therefore, all that needs to be done is to wait for the big change that typically happens once every two years.

He also says that he has put money in Nvidia like Ms. Tapi, and they're waiting for the value of the company to go up. Moreover, Ms. Tapi holds stocks in Vanguard EFT, while Okamoto-san is putting millions of yen in several companies, totaling to 100 million yen. Okamoto-san reveals that one company that currently doesn't make money is Unity.

However, he emphasizes that investors still earn 8.5% from S&P in the long run and explains that this is better than putting money in a savings account in Japan where up until recently earned zero or almost none in interest. This is why Japanese people who want to make more money invest in the said S&P or similar platform.

Finally, Okamoto-san apologizes for his coughing which reminded me of the coughing we also have here in the Philippines. As always, vitamin C is important, although consultation with the doctor is still necessary if there are doubts or some sort of problem.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
