Dear friends,

Today I'd like to share with you what Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto spoke about regarding Thailand, particularly Bangkok, which he says is a place that he'd want to live in someday.

Actually, he explains that quite a lot of foreigners would want to live in Thailand, as compared to other places like Saudi or Indonesia once they retire. One reason is because the commodity prices are cheaper there. Also, there are no destructive earthquakes like the one that occurred recently in Myanmar.

About 10 years ago, Japanese people actually thought of moving to Malaysia. However, the government at the time implemented several regulations that required foreigners to have a monthly income of 1.2 million yen, and have a bank savings of at least 30 million yen, so that not many Japanese people could live in Malaysia.

Finally, Okamoto-san points out that in both countries, Thailand and Malaysia, foreigners can buy houses. For Okamoto-san who has lived in Malaysia for close to seven years, he would still dream of living in Thailand. He also emphasizes that although foreigners can talk with the people using the English language in Malaysia, this isn't so in Thailand. They'd need to speak with the locals in Thai, which, besides the intonation, has its own unique writing system. Still, for Okamoto-san, it's a country that has given him plenty of unforgettable memories.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
