Dear friends,

Today let me share with you what Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto spoke about last night regarding a web service that caters to men and women who are looking for a partner to marry.

First, he explains that almost all of his viewers are men in their 40's and up, and that he thinks that there aren't any young women viewing his video who'd feel bad about his story.

According to Okamoto-san, he's met a taxi driver who told him that he joined the said service and found out that there was a lot of misinformation like, for example, the woman's age isn't as young as she said, or her annual income is actually lower than what she had indicated.

Okamoto-san reveals that it's because the woman wants to marry right away.

This is why he advises us again that we should be careful when getting ourselves into this type of service.

Finally, I'd also like to point out the manner by which Okamoto-san spoke. It reminded me of several scenes from Ms. Yuka and Ms. Hanchan of the "nihongo no mori" YouTube channel, as well as an earlier video of Okamoto-san wherein he said a phrase that Yamapi-san, a Japanese actor, would have said: "yamete kure yo! (You stop it!)"

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
