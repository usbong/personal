> 【めでたい】下村陽子さん英国アカデミー賞『フェローシップ賞』受賞おめでとうございます！！ 

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us the news that his musician friend, Ms. Yoko Shimomura, has been awarded the Fellowship Award by the Academy Awards.

Okamoto-san says that Ms. Shimomura achieved success after working on the music of Street Fighter II. She later composed the music for games like Super Mario RPG and the Mario & Luigi RPG series, and also did the music for the Kingdom Hearts series and Final Fantasy XV, among others, when she moved to Square Enix from Capcom.

Okamoto-san congratulates Ms. Shimomura for winning in the prestigious event.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
