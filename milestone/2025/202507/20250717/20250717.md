Dear friends,

Today I'd like to share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's gameplay footages of Monster Hunter NOW, where he goes out with his companions to fight against two of its giant monsters.

One is called "Odogaron," while another is "Bazerugiusu." Okamoto-san again emphasizes that it's better to hunt these monsters with three friends, because he thinks that there's no way for him to win if he went out only by himself.

Before I end, I'd also like to share with all of you that I've already downloaded the game, and have even tried it out.

I really liked the use of the touch screen to move my character, although it seems that there are still quite a lot of moments when the player has to wait, especially when moving to the map or leaving the map to begin a battle.

Since I currently don't play a lot of this type of game on my smartphone, I think that it's more for players like Okamoto-san.

Finally, I'd also like to add that Pixar and Disney have launched a trailer for its new movie, "Hoppers."

I personally would want to go out to watch it, like when I saw the first trailer of "Super Mario Bros. The Movie" two years ago. 

This is all.

Thank you.
