> カプコン開発『19XX -THE WAR AGAINST DESTINY-』裏話（視聴者リクエストにお応えします）

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is talking about an interesting topic. It's the story behind "19XX -THE WAR AGAINST DESTINY-," a game that Capcom developed and then launched in 1996.

According to Okamoto-san, its producer was only Mr. Noritaka Funamizu, and Okamoto-san himself wasn't particularly involved in this project at all. This is why through this game and Okamoto-san's story, we can better understand the type of games that Funamizu-san creates, as well as which ones Okamoto-san had been involved in.

As we heard from Okamoto-san's explanation, there are several reasons why this game didn't sell as well.

First, there comes a point when the bullets and the enemies have gotten too much and the player can no longer avoid them. This type of chaos isn't something that Okamoto-san enjoys.

Next, when playing the game, the positions of the enemies have to be memorized. For Okamoto-san, this was also too much.

Finally, when Okamoto-san and his team launched "1942," they made it clear that the enemy was Japan. However, in this game, it's quite difficult to figure out whether the enemy is still Japan or some other country.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
