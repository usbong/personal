> 高齢者の「まだ運転できる」は危ない。最適な免許返納のタイミングとは｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us his reason for giving back his driver's license to the government once he reaches 70 years old.

First, he says that while there are senior citizens who stil drive at 80 years old, the risk of meeting an accident is much higher. In his case, he plans to stop early and return to his province to live there.

He tells a story about his grandmother who gave up driving six years ago, though at the start she thought that she could still continue on driving. Eventually, she was able to use another means of transportation like the bus and live her way of life.

Okamoto-san also speaks about his plan to retire from the video games industry when he reaches 66 years old. He's currently 64 and just like with the earlier example, he thinks it's best to retire early even though he feels that he can still continue on working in this industry.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
