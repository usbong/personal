> 【暴露】社会現象を巻き起こした『スト２』の大ヒットの裏で、開発者たちがもらった臨時ボーナスはいくら？｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us a story during the time when he produced "Street Fighter II." This time, the topic is about how much money he and his team received for having produced a successful product.

At the time, the director was Mr. Akira Nishitani, while the programmer was Mr. Shinichi Ueyama. Prior to Street Fighter II, Okamoto-san says that they had both produced the game, "Final Fight." 

According to Okamoto-san, Capcom gave them 2.7 months worth of salary, with an additional 1 million yen for Nishitani-san, and 500,000 yen for Ueyama-san.

Actually, when this 2.7 is compared to the 2.4 given in other companies, it's a little higher, although Okamoto-san admits that, as the producer, he was only given the 2.7 months salary bonus.

Okamoto-san explains that there are two main reasons why Capcom couldn't give out more.

First, the bosses didn't want to give out so much bonus money. 

When the company president, Tsujimoto-san, asked Okamoto-san to turn into numbers all his work contribution, Okamoto-san found that he couldn't put into numbers things like quality.

Second, the company was in a dire situation at the time, so that the bosses couldn't give out a higher bonus to their employees.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
