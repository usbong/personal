Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us gameplay footages of Monster Hunter NOW. He is with his companions, hunting down several monsters, which turn out to be too strong for their team that they couldn't succeed in capturing some of them.

Further, there's a monster called "Ranguratora" that they couldn't capture within the time limit, even though they were already hitting it with their attacks. As the monster was walking away, I was reminded of the TV show Ultraman. 

Next, let me share with you that the Manhattan Prep GMAT channel has uploaded a new video.

The format they use is that the teacher first asks a question about exponents, and then, gives an explanation to the answer. In order to prepare for the GMAT, I've been continuing to read and do the questions in the second textbook, All the Quant + DI, though my pacing is slow. As you all know, questions that we've never seen before are the most difficult, so that those who've already seen them beforehand would, of course, have an advantage.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
