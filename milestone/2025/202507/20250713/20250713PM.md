Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk last night on the game, "War of the Three Kingdoms: Preemptive Strike."

It's a strategy game wherein once the player begins any battle the computer seems to have already calculated its outcome so that what it shows to the player are the steps to reach the end of the fight.

Okamoto-san points out that it's like the pachinko wherein once the player puts in the ball, the machine already knows the outcome.

Okamoto-san also says that the truth is that it uses Web 3.0, particularly, NFT technology, although it doesn't say anything about it. Okamoto-san thinks that the company should announce this fact to everyone.

Finally, the game's title uses the word, "kai," though it can also be pronounced as "sakigake," which Okamoto-san says is used in the manga comic, "Sakigake!! Otoko Juku (Charge!! Men's Private School!)" by Mr. Akira Miyashita. 

Further, the phrase "Sangokushi Taisen" reminded Okamoto-san of a Sega arcade game that also uses that part in its name.

However, it seems that "War of the Three Kingdoms: Preemptive Strike" isn't related to the manga, nor the game by Sega.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
