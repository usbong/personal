> カプコン時代に腹の立った忘れられない一言│岡本吉起塾ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto is sharing with us a story when he got really angry while he was still at Capcom. He says that he was reminded of this incident while he and Ms. OkanP where having a conversation.

During the 40 years since Capcom's founding, when the company reached its 20th year, many family members related to the president at the time, Mr. Kenzo Tsujimoto, were already coming to work within the various departments of the company. 

One day, one of them invited his younger brother to join Capcom. He was also said to have given his brother some advice about work. 

He explained that if the job was done fairly easily, the younger brother should say that it was difficult. In the same way, if the brother was able to complete the job without much effort, he should say that it was extremely difficult.

The moment Okamoto-san heard this advice, he got really angry. At the time, he was already preparing to leave Capcom to form a new one, which is Game Republic. 

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
