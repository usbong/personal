Dear friends,

Last July 16, Amazon made its first public sale. The online retail giant began selling books on the internet in the 90's, and then moved on to selling other products besides books as it opened its platform to merchants online. It now makes more money renting out its servers through Amazon Web Services.

At the time, even in the 90's, people could already make credit card payments, not to mention the fact that the transportation infrastructure in the U.S. could already move goods from one state to the other.

Even today, I think that there aren't a few people who believe that they can make money out of writing books and selling them on Amazon. 

The prospect of selling to millions of users via its platform isn't different from selling games on Steam, or Android apps on Google Play, or iOS apps on the App Store. 

But whichever platform it may be, the question is whether the book or the app could really be part of a stable retirement plan.

My answer is that I wouldn't count on it. 

After studying video game developers and YouTubers for over two years, I found that they make and lose a lot of their money through the buying and selling of stocks.

It's not a regular type of income, and is more of a type of jackpot prize that is quickly used up, or rather, must be used up.

And we can come up with all sorts of explanation why people who win the lottery lose their prize money immediately, but the pattern that we can observe is that they're back at it again, trying to win the lottery the second time, the third time, and indefinitely.

How then can we build a stable retirement plan?

Most people seem to be already okay with at least 20,000 PHP per month, and I think that it's because because most get even less.

At this point, let me share with you another two observations.

One is that even in Singapore and Japan, there are quite a number of people who get caught in investment scams. This is based on news articles that come out quite frequently on online news sites like [Asahi Shimbun](https://www.asahi.com/) and [Zaobao](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/global).

I think that this is related to the goal of making money in a short period of time. People want to make money faster, because they don't have much time left. They know that waiting for five years in a banking product like BPI's Plan Ahead is too slow given that it's only yielding at best 4% net per annum.

That is only 20,000 PHP for 100,000 PHP in five years. As I mentioned earlier, 20,000 PHP is the amount that most older people here in the Philippines would accept for a single month.

My next observation comes from a cancer patient who've since passed away about two decades ago. He was also looking for a way to quickly make money, and eventually struck on the idea of selling cheap Divisoria goods to his pupils. In the end, whatever profit he made didn't seem to have been enough to save his life.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
