Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto and his team had a live streaming on YouTube. As we've heard, they're going to Casa Blanca, although right now, they're in Morocco because that's where they'll need to make a connecting flight.

They departed from Haneda Airport and arrived in Morocco after eight hours. Afterward, they're continuing on to Casa Blanca.

At first I thought that there had been a problem with the microphone, but as it turned out, I had two of their videos playing at the same time, so that the sound was echoing.

I hope they'd have a fun trip this time around.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
