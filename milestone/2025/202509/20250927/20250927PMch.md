He says that up until now only the beta has been launched by studio PocketPair, although Okamoto-san already has news that it'll be officially out the coming year.

On the one hand, of course, there are gamers who'll very much like PalWorld. However, on the other hand, Okamoto-san knows that there are also those who'll not like it at all.

At the moment, Okamoto-san hasn't yet downloaded nor played the beta, but the idea that Nintendo would allow PocketPair to release PalWorld means that Nintendo's IPs like Mario or Zelda could be used in this way as well.

Therefore, Okamoto-san advises people not to buy PalWorld, because afterward known IPs would be imitated by AI without paying anything.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
