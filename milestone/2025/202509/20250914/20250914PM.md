This time he's sharing with us the idea of corporate stocks in relation to the Japanese economy.

He explains that since a long time ago, the stock value of Japanese companies hasn't been going up remarkably, only gradually.

This is why Okamoto-san points out that it's for this reason that they need foreign investments.

He adds that in order to cause this event, the Japanese nation has to lower the value of the Japanese Yen. It's the same idea behind why foreigners will buy more products from Japanese companies when they're cheap. That is, cheaper basically means more purchases.

In addition, he says that he's selling his shares of SoFi and Alphabet which he still has until now. On the other hand, he still doesn't want to sell his Unity shares. 

He explains that it's a lot easier to create games with Unity, and many known games like Pokémon Go, Genshin and Umamusume use it as middleware. The only problem is how to make money.

Finally, he reveals that he's bought a billion yen of Unity shares when they were cheap, and after the significant drop in their market value, it's returned to 50% of its original price. According to a commentary, it's currently 45 USD. Given that he hasn't yet sold his Unity shares, he doesn't believe that it's a huge failure. He continues to hope that the value would go up.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
