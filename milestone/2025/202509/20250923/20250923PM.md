He's very excited to share with us the new rules and improvements that the management has thought up for the game.

First, Okamoto-san points out that when the player joins a Monster Hunter Now event, the range of the area to come across small monsters becomes wider, that is, 1.5 times the usual.

Moreover, the time for monsters to again reappear in a given location is only 30 minutes. Okamoto-san says that at the start, it had been 3 hours, but is now 1 hour after an update. However, during the event, it's further shortened to up to the said duration of 30 minutes.

Finally, Okamoto-san explains that since the player pays to join, he no longer needs to put more money into the game during the events. Therefore, if players are satisfied with the game and continue playing, Okamoto-san says that the game can continue to improve as well.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
