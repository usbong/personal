Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about Mega Sora, a company that works on generating electricity from natural energy.

But first, Okamoto-san shows us that he's taking medicine from Japan to solve his coughing problem. We, of course, hope that he'd quickly recover.

With respect to Mega Sora, actually, Okamoto-san doubts the idea of converting CO₂ to oxygen, even if it's possible. He does, however, like seeing rows of solar panels that have been arranged in a field, and he thinks that it's a pretty sight.

Next, he reveals that although he had bought a car that used alternative energy when the innovation was much talked about, he eventually sold it in the end. This means that, in the short term, he doesn't believe that the value of this type of vehicles would go up.

Also, there were several comments that asked him about work. He responded that he thinks that nowadays it's important to work with foreigners, and that a project from a Japanese studio doesn't necessarily mean that only Japanese people had worked on the project. Furthermore, he points out that he prefers to emphasize more the result of the project, because he says that when he had been at Konami, although he and his companions received overtime pay, he doesn't believe that it's effective for all cases, particularly because a person could receive these payments, even though he didn't actually work so hard.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
