Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about the "Sakura" and the "CB (Cash Backer)" who can be found in Matching Apps, an application for finding a partner or even to marry one.

First, he explains that in the majority of Matching Apps, it's the man, not the woman, who has to pay every month. In addition, he says that although in reality the payment is per message, the system helps users so that they don't have to pay too much.

However, Okamoto-san has found that in a Match App site, 80% of the profiles of women are "Sakura," that is, a person who presses Likes and quickly sends you very short and meaningless messages, but when the user invites her to meet up, she gives excuses like, for example, she's sick or we have to take care due to the flu. 

Moreover, Okamoto-san says that the Sakura are generally CB as well. The latter receives at least five yen (approx 2.5 PHP) per message and they can be found more on sites where there's money than in others where only cheap payments are made.

Finally, Okamoto-san doesn't like the Sakura, saying that in one instance, one of them had given him 400 Likes, so he advises us to always take care of ourselves.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
