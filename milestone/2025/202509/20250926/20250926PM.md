Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about his thoughts regarding lifestyle, where expenses are easy to raise but difficult to bring down.

He explains that there's a rule that states that we should spend up to what we earn as income. 

During the time when Okamoto-san was much younger, university students, who had 80,000 yen per month (now 200,000 yen or approx. 100,000 PHP), spent all their money, and never invested a percent of this amount. Okamoto-san points out several possible reasons for this outcome. For example, there was peer pressure or the person wanted to experience the rich life, among others.

Okamoto-san also gives his own example with his house in Malaysia. He reveals that he spends money for three rooms, but only one is actually used. So, since he doesn't have visitors everyday, he loses money for the cost of the two that he continues to pay each day. However, he thinks that in the end, the passive income that he earns is higher than his expenses so that he doesn't worry about this aspect.

In addition, he says that there are Japanese who are content in Japan, but Okamoto-san advises everyone that they should look outside of Japan too, because there are many more places that they can learn about. He also points out that what can be enjoyed with 10,000 yen (approx. 5,000 PHP), in reality, isn't different from 20,000 yen so that they shouldn't worry about the expenses too much. In this part of his talk, Okamoto-san is concerned about the Japanese who may feel terrible when they can't immediately increase their expenses for their kind of lifestyle.

Finally, it's really difficult to bring down a person's expenses, but for Okamoto-san who lives outside Japan, if from an investment of 10 million yen (approx. 5 million PHP) in one year, 800,000 yen or 70,000 yen per month is returned, life wouldn't be too bad, because, as in his example with the students, he believes that people can make do with less, specifically, 150,000 yen of 200,000 yen, while the remaining 50,000 yen is invested.

This is all.

Thank you.
