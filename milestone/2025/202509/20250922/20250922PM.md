Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about a luxury cruise trip advertisement that costs 2.5 million yen (approx. 1.25 million PHP).

First, he says that the story of Hikakin-san, a TV personality of some sort, was so spectacular that Okamoto-san wanted to travel in the same way as well.

However, after researching about it, he found that people, who've joined the trip, say that there were too many travelers. They even brought their children with them.

Therefore, a person who wanted to use the swimming pool wouldn't be able to do so. Furthermore, the traveler should share the room with up to five other people whom he'd likely never met before.

So Okamoto-san points out that the difference between Hikakin-san's ad and the actual is so big that in the end, Okamoto-san doesn't want to travel in such a way anymore. However, he believes that maybe Hikakin-san had paid more to receive special treatment, so that not too many people traveled with him. But for an ordinary person, it seems to him that the level of service that he'd receive is too low.

Finally, Okamoto-san advises us that before spending, specifically, 2.5 million yen (approx. 1.25 million PHP) for five days, let's first study carefully the offer.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
