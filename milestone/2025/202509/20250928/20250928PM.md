It's about Street Fighter II X, which was only released on 3DO, the new console from Panasonic (Matsushita).

First, Okamoto-san admits that he doesn't know the exact reason, but he has some ideas for the decision.

In addition, he says that during that time, Mr. Takashi Nishiyama had left Capcom, and another man from another industry, "Mr. S," came to be the manager. Actually, he became Okamoto-san's boss.

According to Okamoto-san, Mr. S was the person who told him that Street Fighter II X would be launched exclusively on Panasonic's 3DO. He didn't give any explanation, but Okamoto-san thinks that there were probably two reasons for this decision.

One is that among the consoles at the time, specifically, the Super Famicom, the PSOne and the Sega Saturn, only the new 3DO could run the game, which was initially launched for the arcades.

Next, Okamoto-san believes that Capcom received a favorable agreement with Panasonic so that the bosses at Capcom decided to release Street Fighter II X only on 3DO. Okamoto-san also thinks that Mr. S. got "kickbacks" in the form of special treatment, among others, because he heard that the decision was made while playing in the golf course.

Finally, Okamoto-san didn't want the game to be released only on one console. He also didn't like bribes.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
