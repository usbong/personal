Dear friends,

Okamoto-san tells us the type of watch that he likes.

He explains that he buys Rolex watches that cost 900,000 yen (approx. 450,000 PHP) up to 2 or 4 million yen (approx. 1 or 2 million PHP), even though they were originally owned by another person.

In addition, although he knows about Tag Heuer, he'll only buy it for his collection and won't use it at all, because he thinks that it won't go well with the clothes that he wears. He prefers the Italian style of fashion, which he points out is bright and is a lot closer to the color white, instead of the one from the U.K., which uses black for everything if a man were to decide.

Also, he says that he gives out watches as gifts to people whom he likes. For example, he gives a watch to the CEO of studio Deluxe Games (DeraGe) every year.

He relates that one of the family members of Capcom President Kenzo Tsujimoto, a chief as well but lower in rank, actually a section chief, had given Okamoto-san a watch, and even up to now, Okamoto-san hasn't forgotten the gesture.

Finally, he reveals that maintaining watches at times would cost 20,000 yen per year, and owning two or more means that the person has to spend more money too. But since one is already expensive, he thinks that the total cost wouldn't be too much.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
