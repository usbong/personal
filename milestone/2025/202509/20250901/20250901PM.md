Dear friends,

A pleasant morning to all of you. Since a couple days ago, we've been having heavy rainfall, which is why there are times when we can't access the internet here in Marikina City.

Regardless, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto shares with us in his talk last night the topic: The habits to increase our self-esteem.

He points out that oftentimes we're dissatisfied with what we've accomplished, because we think that we can achieve more. For instance, it may be that we want each and every one of our works to be considered fantastic.

But Okamoto-san explains that although the reality may be different, that is, only a few of our works are excellent, if our objective is clear, and we've developed the habit of working hard and studying what we still don't know, for example, even if 99% ends up useless, we'll still be able to achieve success by continuing to strive onward.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
