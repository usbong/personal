> [Season 7 Begins] Let me tell you about the dramatic changes to Monster Hunter Now!

This time he wants to tell us that although he had some negative comments about the game before, it seems to him that the management has changed for the better, and he wants to express his joy for this improvement.

We may recall that Okamoto-san had pointed out several aspects of the game that he didn't like, and he'll be talking about them in detail during the next part of his talk.

He emphasizes that due to the current situation, what's most important is to reduce the errors rather than introduce more new features in order to improve the game.

Finally, he wants us to also write our comments with respect to the game.

So let me reiterate that the game makes effective use of the touchscreen on mobile devices in order to control the user's character during combat.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
