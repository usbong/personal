Dear friends,

Today let me share with you something other than a video from Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto who seems to have opted to get some rest last night.

> RAID: Shadow Legends x Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles | The Chase (Official Commercial)

## --

I'll be talking about the commercial, RAID: Shadow Legends x Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which I only saw yesterday.

It attracted me particularly because it was about the Ninja Turtles and Leonardo's armor in the cover page seemed to me something that's actually from the samurai's. I think that it's a great concept, given that we may recall that the Turtles don't wear any clothing aside from their belts.

Moreover, I remembered the comic book story where Batman fought Superman, and Batman had to put on a heavy armor for his fight against the Man of Steel. His big stature didn't look too bad either.

After viewing the commercial, the shoulders of the characters also reminded me of Mr. Frog from Yaiba, the party member who was originally a general of Takeshi Onimaru, Yaiba's rival.

Finally, I want to say that among the Ninja Turtles films, my favorite is the third. It's about their journey to the past when foreigners sold weapons like rifles to the Japanese warlords.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
