First, he explains that people often say negative things like, for example, "I'd prefer doing this feature" or "I wouldn't do this component of the game this way," among others. But what Okamoto-san points out is that despite all that's happened, the team was able to produce this result. And it's for this reason that studio Niantic makes Okamoto-san very happy.

In addition, Okamoto-san says that the goal of Niantic since the start has been to make people walk. So players would have to go to places where they'd normally not go. If not, they wouldn't encounter any monster or item at all. Therefore, Okamoto-san believes that the studio has achieved its main objective.

This is all.

Thank you.
