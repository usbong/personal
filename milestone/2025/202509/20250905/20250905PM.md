Dear friends,

Today let me share with you some of the salient points in Mr. Joi Ito's general meeting yesterday morning.

As always, Mr. Comugi shared several news about digital currencies, and what I'd like to emphasize is the part about mercari and Coincheck. According to Mr. Comugi, mercari is the front-end platform where buyers come to buy merchandise, while at the back, there's Coincheck. It's like what we know supermarkets use in order to receive digital payments, although Coincheck's cryptocurrency has been added in this case.

Next, what I'd also like to emphasize is the presentation from Mr. Tomoe Makino of Tools for Humanity. It's about the project, "World," which was established by Sam Altman and others in 2019. He says that they want a person to be able to give only the necessary information when he pays. It's because when we show our ID cards, other information aside from our names such as our address is divulged. I recall that in Taiwan, for example, the waitress at the hotel will ask us our address when we pay using the credit card. So this project is an initiative to improve security by not divulging unnecessary information.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
