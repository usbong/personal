First, he points out that there's a city called Denen Chofu that is quite far from central Tokyo, and where more elderly people live. He explains that it's because young people prefer to live in the "tawaman (residential buildings)," given that it's more convenient for them to live there, although Okamoto-san finds that these buildings are already turning into slum areas.

Also, although there's an option to sell the house, nobody wants to buy it, because, for example, it's inconvenient to live in a place quite far away from central Tokyo. So in the end, it means forfeiting the house.

However, the inheritance law allows the next generation to take on debt in order to pay for the cost of the entire house per year. And there are actually people who choose this option.

Therefore, only the elderly live in the expensive housing, while young people live in the buildings close to central Tokyo.

Finally, after learning about the current situation of these two types of housing, Okamoto-san advises people to look at the housing in the ports. He foresees that their prices won't be declining anytime soon. 

This is all.

Thank you.
