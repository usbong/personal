In this occasion, we can see them in another place to eat the yakiniku of WA NO NIKU, a hawker stall.  

The owner, Tetsu-san, reveals that there still aren't a lot of hawkers offering this type of food, which also includes Japanese rice.

In addition, Tetsu-san shows that what he's ordered is the MEGAMORI SET, which has several of the best parts of the cow, that is to say, those near the head, which is why they're very tender. They total 800 g and cost 100 SGD.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
