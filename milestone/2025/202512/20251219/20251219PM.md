It involves the death of a married couple in their thirties while they were using a sauna in Akasaka. Okamoto-san says that it was a high class sauna where each use of the sauna for 120 minutes would cost 19,000 yen.

Next, Okamoto-san points out that according to the owner of the said sauna, he's never plugged in the emergency bell. Furthermore, Okamoto-san wonders the reason why the couple couldn't open the door of the sauna to leave.

Finally, Okamoto-san hopes that this incident may not happen again, and emphasizes that he doesn't want more lives of its users to be lost.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
