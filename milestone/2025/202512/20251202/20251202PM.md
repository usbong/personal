In particular, in games like Epic Games' Fortnight, players have the opportunity to play minigames inside its world. These are said to have been created using the Unreal Engine. This time, it's now possible to create these minigames using the Unity Engine.

Okamoto-san explains that he has used the Unreal Engine before, and he believes that it's easier to create games with Unity's engine. Furthermore, he reiterates that since he likes Unity so much, he's bought shares of the company, even though their value has gone done a lot recently.

In an Epic Games' game wherein around 500 million players have joined in, Okamoto-san predicts that through this collaboration, the number of developers would go up 10 times, especially because Unity is an engine that's used by 90% of indie game developers.

This is all.

Thank you.
