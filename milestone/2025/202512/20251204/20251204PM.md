Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk about the taxes in Japan.

It's about the new rule that brings the 20% tax on profits from the sale of stocks to 30%.

Okamoto-san doesn't like this rule, because it means that after reaching the point where a person has achieved a high income, he'd need to pay more tax.

Furthermore, Okamoto-san says that from 2003 to 2013, the tax for profits made from selling corporate shares was only 10%. He reveals that actually it's a rule that was extended for up to 10 years due to popular demand. But this time, what the Japanese have to pay has increased to 30%.

Okamoto-san also shares that he read a comment that said that the gold that he had sold has at least 50% tax. He responds that this tax applies in Japan, but since he lives in Malaysia, he doesn't need to pay any tax related to his earnings from its sale. Therefore, he says that the wealthiest Japanese would now prefer to live outside Japan.

Finally, given that Okamoto-san wants more wealthy Japanese, he hopes that this new rule, which increases the tax to 30%, won't get implemented.

This is all.

Thank you.
