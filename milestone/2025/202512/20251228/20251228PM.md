Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's video three days ago about his prediction that the value of gold will further go up.

First, Okamoto-san reminds us that he had sold all the gold that he owned, because he needed the money for several of his expenses during that time. However, he's thinking about buying gold again, especially after obtaining information that there aren't a lot of people in the U.S. who have gold (ETF gold) right now. 

Okamoto-san explains that rich people own 10% of their wealth in gold, and since they don't need to sell it, the value of gold goes up even further. He continues that it's only when a person sells the gold that he owns that the value goes down.

Finally, Okamoto-san reiterates that he wants to own gold again, although not in its physical form like before.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
