Okamoto-san says that the company seems to be weakening.

He explains that, firstly, Apple uses something called "The Apple Tax." This means that every application that is on its platform should pay it 30% of its profits. So if the app earns 100 million yen, the developer ought to pay Apple 30 million yen.

Okamoto-san believes that it's too much. Furthermore, given that Google and Apple occupy 95% of the market, the courts have accused them of monopolistic practices.

But Okamoto-san explains that in reality this Apple Tax is only 5% of the total earnings of the company. Therefore, if this 30% were 15%, only 2.5% would be taken from Apple.

Okamoto-san also reveals that there's a new rule that actually brings down this 30% to 15% for minigames. However, Okamoto-san believes that it's better that the rule brings it down to 8%, especially when we consider the situation of their developers.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
