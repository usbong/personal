Okamoto-san says that when we abandon a task, we'd have many excuses, and we'd also find that it's something very easy to do. But he points out that only the person, who hasn't given up, could achieve success.

Still, Okamoto-san believes that most likely this person, who's achieved success, also committed innumerable mistakes. Furthermore, he thinks that most people give up their dreams after thinking about the task at hand and believed that it's something impossible for him to accomplish.

Okamoto-san also says that humans are beings that must overcome challenges, otherwise they'll regret that the opportunity has already passed them.

Next, Okamoto-san gives the example of his own life wherein he moved to Malaysia, and established a company in order to develop games. But he says that he'll be retiring from the video game industry very soon. Nevertheless, he reiterates that he still wants to overcome new challenges like, for example, developing a board game and becoming an architect. 

In addition, although he foresees that he'll surely commit many mistakes, he believes that it's better that he has tried to overcome these challenges. Moreover, he emphasizes that these mistakes would help strengthen him in order to stand up again.

Finally, he concludes that we likely have only one life, so let's achieve success by overcoming new challenges.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
