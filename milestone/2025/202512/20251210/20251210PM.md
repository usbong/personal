He's announced that the new console from Nintendo has sold over 10 million units.

According to Okamoto-san, it's a huge success, and he congratulates Nintendo for it.

Next, Okamoto-san explains that the Switch 2 not only can run games from Switch, the console that preceded the current Switch 2, it can also run these games a lot faster and more smoothly.

However, we also have to say something about the games that have been launched especially for the Switch 2. Okamoto-san mentioned Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza. He says that since he prefers games wherein he doesn't need to press the buttons too quickly like in the case of action games, he didn't play these games for more than two weeks, particularly DK Bananza. 

He then talks about Kirby Air Riders, which he looks forward to a lot, because he likes Mr. Masahiro Sakurai and he respects him very much. This is why he says that he's going to buy the game and play it as well.

Finally, he admits that he's bought two of the Switch 2, and he tries very hard not to let all the energy inside their batteries get used up. He says that it's a task that he can still do.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
