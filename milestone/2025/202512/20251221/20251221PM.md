I'd also like to focus on this part of the trailer, which I thought was funny because of the scene as well as the music that reminded me of retro video games. In addition, after this part, there's another funny scene wherein the rules of the Animal Kingdom are questioned.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
