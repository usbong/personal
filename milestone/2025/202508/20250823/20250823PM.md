Dear friends,

Today I have for you two videos.

The first one is from Nakaido's radio program where several people are with Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto in an interview.

Howevever, it seems that they're still not ready, and I think that we should wait a little bit more for their next video with respect to Okamoto-san's talk.

I'd also like say that I had already listened to their previous program when Okamoto-san mentioned it, though I didn't like it.

I think it's because of the speaker's personality which comes out through his voice or the way he speaks that didn't attract me.

In this case, I was reminded of the young Filipinos who play in eSports tournaments and appear in videos on YouTube.

My impression is that they play, because they actually have many problems at home, most likely related to money, and since they can't do well in school, they prefer to play games instead.

Next, I'd like to share with you that I've again viewed Okamoto-san's video of four years ago about the reason why the PlayStation console won against Nintendo's.

In a few words, the third-party developers couldn't make much money within Nintendo's system, so Sony studied their complaints, and corrected them by the time the company launched its first console, the PlayStation.

Examples of these complaints included third-party developers not getting enough revenues, the cartridges where the roms of the games were placed being expensive, and the duration to manufacture the cartridge needing three months.

However, Okamoto-san revealed that for the developers of arcade games, the PlayStation had been a console that was pretty difficult to create games with, because it had less RAM. 

According to Okamoto-san, he and his team wanted double the current RAM of the PlayStation. He also pointed out that the console was actually made more for RPG's.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
