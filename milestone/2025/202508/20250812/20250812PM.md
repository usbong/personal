Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's interesting talk about the history of the "CPS," which means "Capcom System," although the people at Capcom initially thought that it should be "CCS," because the company is, in fact, Capsule Computer.

Now what I'd like to emphasize is the part in Okamoto-san's story where he says that their team at Capcom actually wanted to launch a new system (or motherboard) to defend themselves against the people who made pirated copies that could run on the current system.

Unfortunately, even though Okamoto-san and his companions worked hard, their new product, an advanced piece of hardware called CPS, quickly encountered the said problem of illegal copying.

Okamoto-san points out that in countries like China and Spain, people have the skills to do this task rather quickly, and when I heard this part, I was reminded of the news from DW News on China's investment in southern Spain where factories are being built.

Okamoto-san also tells of a conversation that he had with Mr. Kenzo Tsujimoto, Capcom's president at the time, about the CPS' speed, and I wondered if they were working with companies like Fujitsu during that time to test and design computers. 

As an engineer, I know that the software side can help in making the movement of an application go much faster.

Lastly, I'd like to also say that last Sunday, I tried out Marvel vs Capcom 2 (MVC2) on Steam for about an hour, and I felt that I already own a Dreamcast, which I never had during those years in the 2000's.

It's like the old childhood dream of having one's own arcade machine, or like in my case, the initial interest that I had in learning how to program on video game consoles, even though I'd later find out that consoles are just computers with controllers, among other things.

Also, something very curious in the Steam version of MVC2 is that movement in the game at times slows down. I don't know if it's also like that on the Dreamcast.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
