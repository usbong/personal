Dear friends,

Today I have two videos for you.

One is from Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto who talks about the kabuto mushi, an insect that he found in Malaysia, and which also exists in Japan.

The second is from Forbes about the Ayala Empire, a very well-known group that was established 191 years ago and continues to exist in the Philippines.

Okamoto-san explains that one thing that he's grateful of is having met the kabuto mushi insects, which there are only a few left in Japan. He focuses on the "hime kabuto mushi" or the kabuto mushi princess, a type which has a face that's like human teeth in that it has an upper and lower parts.

They actually look like cockroaches to me, although Okamoto-san's example walks on his hand without trying to escape at all. I think that if these kabuto mushi eat dirty food they'll also have a bad smell.

Next, I'd like to share with you the announcement from Forbes about the famous group called Ayala, and, in particular, Ms. Mariana Beatriz Zobel de Ayala, the daughter of the head boss, Mr. Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala.

Forbes says that she worked in the office of JP Morgan Chase & Co. in New York, and then, returned to the Philippines when her father called her up about opportunities in the country through the Ayala Corp. She was 24 years old during that time. For 12 years, she learned the company's system, and is now its managing director at 36 years old.

The announcement interests me, because I use the group's services, and I'd like to know what Forbes is saying.

Finally, I think that it's educational to also understand family businesses and the way to be able to continue longer than only up to the third generation.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
