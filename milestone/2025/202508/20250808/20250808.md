Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's YouTube Live video last night. He was sharing with us his thoughts on what he can do to revitalize his province called Ainancho in Ehime prefecture, which is located in the island of Shikoku.

But first, he says that he's with Ms. Tapi waiting to be admitted in the hospital. It seems that his coughing since three weeks ago still hasn't disappeared.

Next, he tells us that in truth what he wants is probably not what other people, particularly those from the city, may think about when they visit the provinces.

He points out that to arrive in his hometown, people would have to use narrow roads, because the national highway ends and doesn't reach his home.

He says that he prefers that visitors can experience the beach that is so natural that it isn't yet called a resort. He also adds that there are farmlands in his province where the mikan (or ponkan) are cultivated and which are very delicious and huge, costing 1,000 yen apiece.

In addition, he thinks about further developing his hometown, putting on the mountains attractions such as casinos that can give jobs to the people.

Finally, I believe that a person who is contributing so much to the community is valued more, and therefore, in turn, receive the support that will help him live longer.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
