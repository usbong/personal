Okamoto-san reveals that there's been a request recently for Morishita-san to resign from his position.

He points out that since Morishita-san owns the most number of shares of the studio, if there's anyone who doesn't agree with the management of Morishita-san, he can buy more shares in order to be the president.

He also explains the possible reasons for why this event has occurred. 

First, it appears that the studio has launched only one game, specifically Puzzle & Dragons, which has earned substantially for the company. So Okamoto-san believes that a new game has to be created, and in order to accomplish this task, the studio can already end further development of the said Puzzle & Dragons.

Next, there are people who think that actually the studio will continue to survive even though it has another president, and the only thing that Morishita-san is doing is buying more shares of the company.

Also, if the company is really not earning as much, it's a wonder why the current president has taken more income for himself.

Finally, since Okamoto-san is more of a developer than a manager, he prefers to focus on the quality of the studio's products, even though the revenues, including the profits, aren't very high. Doing both, however, is indeed a difficult balancing act.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
