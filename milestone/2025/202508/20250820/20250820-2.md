Dear friends,

Today let me share with you the University of the Philippines - Manila Standards and Interoperability Lab (UPM SILab)'s Zoom webinar last July 9, 2025.

The topic was on making use of Electronic Health Records (EHC) to provide Universal Health Care in North Bohol.

The presenter, Dr. Reina Juno Sumatra, spoke about the use of the Department of Health (DOH)-developed iClinicSys EHR in North Bohol. The system is said to be recognized as one of the best in interoperability, although capacity building in the form of user training still has to continue.

During the Q&A session after the presentation, DOH Undersecretary Dr. Mario Villaverde posed the question on why people can use Viber and TikTok but are having a hard time using the EHR.

In my opinion, it's because development of the EHR would continue with or without the participation of the people in the local communities. There are still other communities who are more inclined toward such things after all.

It follows the same line of thinking as the observation that people dying won't stop the world from moving. More people are being created anyway. 

In this regard, the rate of production is much faster than the system can accommodate to truly provide health care for all. This is why there are still street children and beggars, among other types of homeless people in the Philippines. 

There are even more who are willing to lie and steal in order to survive, resulting to misinformation, which, in turn, translates to more work for those who already do.

Therefore, decreasing the rate of childbirth would reduce the number of street children, because there will be less students crowding the public schools. These students will later have the skills necessary to find jobs that would give them income enough for their daily expenses.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
