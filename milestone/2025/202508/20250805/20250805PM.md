Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's perspective on the lawsuit filed by Sony against Tencent for infringing the copyright of its game, Horizon, with Tencent's newly released game called Light of Moritam.

He points out that the look as well as the story of Tencent's game are the same with those found in Sony's own game, so that Sony has filed a legal case against Tencent.

Okamoto-san also says that Sony sees Tencent as a company that doesn't want to grow anymore with its launching of a game that is very similar to Sony's or one from FromSoftware.

However, according to Okamoto-san, Tencent had contacted Sony asking if they could work on a project together, but Sony rejected the invitation.

Finally, Okamoto-san believes that Sony won't win in this lawsuit, and Tencent will escape punishment, although only barely.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
