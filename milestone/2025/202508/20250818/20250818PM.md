He begins with a story about his mother who at first told him that she eats spicy food, but changed her mind once she came to Southeast Asia.

Okamoto-san explains that the spicy food in Southeast Asia is a lot more spicy than in Japan. He also says that he respects people who aren't afraid to eat such food.

Moreover, he finds that after eating spicy food, other dishes also begin to appear to be spicy. He points out that there are actually cases where the person may feel pain in the nose or stomach. In addition, it's said that the possibility of contracting cancer will be much higher.

In the end, I personally believe that after seeing many cases of sick patients at the clinic for close to 10 years, it's essential to have both money and wisdom in order to live longer. 

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
