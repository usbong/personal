Dear friends,

Today I'd like to share with you IGN's video on gamescom 2025.

First, it interested me, because I want to understand the reason why gamescom is organized by Germany every year.

According to IGN, over 1,500 exhibitions from 75 countries came together in gamescom this month. It's really a massive event that took place in some 233,000 square meters of space.

So although it seems that unlike Japan, there aren't a lot of German studios in existence, the country has in fact a large market of gamers who consume video games.

Now before I end, I want to also say that the camera of the video made me a little dizzy, so do take care when you view it.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
