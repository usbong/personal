The topic was about "Bad Cheese," a new game that has a 1920's Disney feel to it.

Okamoto-san says that in Japan, animation, including characters from the 1970's, for instance, aren't anymore seen on TV. He also gave well-known examples like Doraemon, Popeye, Mickey Mouse and Gundam (the first generation), which have classic versions.

Next, he says that in the 90's, during around 1995, Disney had been strict in terms of copyrights, and had likely not allowed another company to use them without its permission.

However, Okamoto-san points out that if the drawings of Mickey Mouse or something similar to Mickey Mouse were used in schools, it wouldn't be necessary to pay for the copyright, and it's okay to use them.

In addition, he gives an example where a store in Japan used the face of Mickey Mouse on their bread, and was penalized. Ms. Tapi says that it had been similar to the Anpan-man bread that can be seen today.

Also, Okamoto-san explains that lawyers in Japan generally have standard pricing for clients who may want to avail of their services. But one way to get them to work harder is to give them higher incentives if they can win the case in court.

Finally, although Okamoto-san believes that the game, Bad Cheese, only almost didn't infringe Disney's copyrights, he doesn't want to be where it's at, nor does he want to go through such type of experience. That is, it's better to have Disney's copyrights.

Before closing, I'd also like to share with you Okamoto-san's answer regarding several questions that came up after his talk. In particular, he was asked his advice on how to become a video game producer.

He answered that while each person would have a  different experience, it appears to him that if the person can achieve success with one game, for example, within seven years, he'll have the opportunity to become a video game producer.

However, to produce a game these days, 2 up to 10 billion yen would be necessary, and Okamoto-san says that after retiring and leaving the corporate world, he wants to create games like those from indie game developers.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
