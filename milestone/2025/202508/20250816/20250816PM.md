First, he points out that he's never played GTA 1 and 2, because he began to learn about the series starting from 3, and during that time, he had thought about bringing the game to Japan through Capcom. He also says that the game was so popular in other countries that it must also be brought to Japan.

However, since it's a game where violence and other criminal activities have to be committed, it had to be sold in specific places like, for instance, a store in Akihabara, Tokyo. Therefore, a buyer from another city in Kanagawa had to go to Akihabara in order to buy it.

Okamoto-san says that, in addition, in the U.S. there are ratings like those from the Computer Entertainment Rating Origanization (CERO) so that parents, for example, will know if a game is good for children or not. He adds that there was also a research study where it was found out that the majority of the participants from secondary school responded that they play GTA.

Finally, Okamoto-san is excited for the new and upcoming GTA. He points out that GTA 5 had sold 100 million copies, and earned trillions of yen. So he expects a spectacular performance for GTA 6 as well.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
