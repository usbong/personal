Dear friends,

Tonight I have two pieces of news for you. The first one is about Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's talk on "Area 51," a place in the U.S. The second one is about the talk by Japan's former Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, on the meaning of life.

First, Okamoto-san says that in the U.S., there's actually a place called "Area 51," and there are people who say that aliens are being researched there. However, while the CIA has confirmed the existence of the said place, no aliens are actually there.

It might be because the researchers are working on advanced tech nology that is involved with stealth that the rumor about aliens had spread. For Okamoto-san, a person who tells lies would need to keep on telling lies up until the end, and is therefore difficult to trust. Okamoto-san explains that if the person's intention had been to get people to believe him, then it would have been better if he told the truth right from the start.

Next, we move on to former Prime Minister Kishida's talk, where he spoke to students about the idea that people who've found the meaning of life can be grateful, and therefore can also be grateful for their own life. At 67, the former Prime Minister says that he's still doing his best to accept the above statement.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
