> きちんと自分の気持ちを伝えられてますか？相手に真意が伝わるワードの選び方｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's theme for tonight is communication.

He says that the most important thing that we should remember whenever we talk in front of people is to be able to convey what we want to say.

According to Okamoto-san, most people, for one reason or another, aren't able to do this well, so that they lose the opportunity given them. As a result, for instance, the person fails the oral exam conducted by the human resources department of a certain company.

Finally, Okamoto-san explains that whenever he speaks, he always thinks about his audience, and refrains from using extremely difficult words that his audience wouldn't be able to understand.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
