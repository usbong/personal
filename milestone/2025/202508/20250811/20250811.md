Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's topic last night: The Camping Car. It's a way for travelers to stay for the night inside their own vehicle whenever they leave the house.

Okamoto-san also gives several advantages and disadvantages of this type of experiencing a vacation. 

For instance, he says that he doesn't like the idea of reserving a room in a hotel and do things like check-in and check-out. Therefore, with the camping car, he'd already have a room and won't need to do any of those things at all.

However, as a disadvantage, finding a restroom will be a problem, especially for women. This is why he says that it's just a hobby that generally caters to men.

Next, he points out that if a person already has a camping car, then he won't need a tent anymore. He also wouldn't need to do things that go with having a tent, such as cleaning it after the trip.

Still, a camping car costs 15 million yen (approx. 7.5 million pesos), meaning that it's quite expensive if the person is only thinking about using it for a few days. In this regard, the price of a room at a hotel is a lot cheaper.

This is all.

Thank you.
