But first, he explains that he's already been admitted to the hospital, and he's recording his video there.

Next, he says that he wants to share with us the announcement that the McDonald's "Happy Set" (or Happy Meal) will be getting special Pokémon cards, and that Okamoto-san foresees that there will be collectors who, in order to get hold of the said cards, will be buying so much that it appears to Okamoto-san that people should think about whether these collectors are also going to eat so much. If not, it's better that they have the option to choose how the money would be spent, instead of immediately using it for the food included in the Happy Meal.

For instance, according to Okamoto-san, the buyers can donate the money to schools or organizations for the homeless.

Finally, he gives the reason why collectors want the cards so much. He explains that it's because they think that the said cards will sell later for a much higher price.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,
