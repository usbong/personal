Dear friends, 

Today I'd like to share with you Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto's new video.

It's about the news that the value of Capcom's shares had dropped 9.5%. Okamoto-san explains in the video the reason for the significant drop. 

First, he says that Monster Hunter Wilds (MHW) wasn't able to sell as well as had been expected. In general, a successful game could sell at least 4.18 million copies. However, in this case, MHW couldn't sell as much.

Okamoto-san points out that the company needs to launch a game that more people would want, and he advises people to buy the company's shares, whose value is currently low and therefore cheap, the moment the company succeeds in bringing out such a game into the market.

Otherwise, he foresees that Capcom will be in the same situation as Square Enix.

I believe that what he means by this is that people would think that all that Capcom does is launch poor-quality games, while its employees depend too much on the value of the company's shares in order to make money.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
