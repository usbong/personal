Dear friends,

Today let me share with you Yoshiki Okamoto-san and team's new video on the game, Monster Hunter NOW.

In the video, we can see them fighting against the monster, Neromieru. Okamoto-san says that he's with his usual companions from before and that they are together again to hunt down the said monster.

After viewing their video for eight minutes, my impression is that this time the battle is much more spectacular than before, because the monster moves a lot more and has more animations.

This is why the hunters, for their part, have to move farther away from the monster to shoot it down, or at times they'd have to come close to it in order to hit its head.

Finally, I think that if the text can be made larger, that is, the interface part, then maybe the game could be so much better. Perhaps, it could be like the one used in the game, Yuusha Yamada-kun, by Onion Games.

This is all.

Thank you.
