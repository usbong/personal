Dear friends,

Last night, Mr. Yoshiki Okamoto spoke about the CPS-2 or the Capcom System-2.

In his earlier talk, Okamoto-san said that the CPS was the most advanced piece of technology that Capcom had built. This time he continues by saying that they actually used this technology for six years.

He explains that when a motherboard is used for so long, of course, it'll encounter the problem of not anymore being the most advanced. So Okamoto-san says that his team developed the next CPS, which is CPS-2, and that they changed the CPS' that were in the stores with the new CPS-2.

However, since Street Fighter 2 moved better on the CPS than on the Super Famicom, another team from the company thought of selling it to the hobbyists, although in the end the old CPS couldn't sell as much, and the rest of the motherboards remained in the company warehouse.

Also, something that Okamoto-san emphasizes is the part about the sound called Q Sound. It's a way to emit sound in order to create a 3D experience, although as Okamoto-san has explained, at the arcades the game's music, among other things, couldn't be heard well, because the machines were too close to each other.

Lastly, I'd like to connect this talk with the one from Ms. OkanP and Mr. Tokuro Fujiwara.

Fujiwara-san had revealed that the owners of the stores didn't want to let Capcom's salespeople put the arcade machines inside their stores if they couldn't make money for the owners. So the salespeople had to show that their games were effective in helping the owners make money.

I think that Capcom's salespeople had to ask people to play in those stores, although the game itself should have surely also made an impact on the visitors for them to put money in the said machines.

This is all.

Thank you.
